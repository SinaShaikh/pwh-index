"My Fellow Belizeans,"
"The sounds of the Corona alarm are everywhere   on television, from social media, and in our conversations with friends and family."
"I know this is an excruciatingly stressful time for all of us. It is even more so for our senior citizens, those who have lost their jobs and our frontline health care workers."
"We rightly worry about our individual and collective situations. After all, as a nation we are facing the greatest crisis of modern times."
"In these extreme circumstances, at this extraordinary moment, I have felt it my duty to come to you directly. I am most conscious of the wonderful help the Nation has received from so many people. First among them is the medical team led by the Ministry of Health and the Karl Heusner Memorial Hospital. The Doctors Manzanero, CEO Gough, others in the leadership brain trust, the Hon Minister of Health and most particularly the frontline workers at the KHMH and the other public hospitals: they all deserve our highest praise and our greatest thanks."
"As well we are indebted to the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues, all the social partners represented on the National Oversight Committee and the National COVID-19 Task Force. These are bodies on which all GOB CEOs, the Leader of Opposition’s representatives and very many expert Belizeans are serving."
"On your behalf, I offer them our profound gratitude. And I wish to declare how much I personally have benefited from this national partnership and its collective decision-making process."
"In the end, though, as Prime Minister I am the one who has to accept the ultimate responsibility for custody of the nation’s wellbeing. Especially in this time of an existential crisis of seemingly Old Testament proportions, I must personally come before you. Hence the reason for this address."
"My primary message is to assure that you are not alone, neither in your anxiety about the present challenges nor your preoccupation about the future."
"I thus reiterate to every Belizean that my administration, together with the national committees, will spare no effort, will action every partnership, will lose no opportunity to cushion the economic impacts and minimize the medical repercussions of this pandemic."
"You know that neither the depth nor the duration of this battle is yet clear. In this connection, Belize and all countries — from the richest to the poorest — are in the same boat. We face a lethal, deadly enemy that refuses to stay still long enough for us to get a bead on it."
What is nevertheless also clear is that our country is properly positioning itself for this battle. We do so both on the economic and the medical fronts.
"First and most important, we can feed ourselves. And there are two things that are important in this connection. The global supply chain that facilitates imports of essential inputs for our country is not being broken. Even more important, though, is the fact of Belize’s self-sufficiency in all basic commodities. With our local production of grains, meats, vegetables and poultry products we are able to dig in for the long haul. That is what sets us apart."
"Second, Government is determined to deploy a diverse range of fiscal and monetary measures to fortify our economic structures and bring us through. Our measures include aid to the newly unemployed and the longer unemployed; commercial banking and credit union support to business and the self-employed; and one form or another of customer relief from our utility providers. Broadly speaking, all options are on the table and every backing we can at all come up with will be used to stabilize the economy and underpin the welfare of the people."
"Third, our team of public healthcare professionals — reinforced by a first-rate medical brigade from our Cuban allies and buttressed by a massive investment in emergency equipment and supplies — will relentlessly identify, isolate and treat cases of COVID-19."
"I repeat that, as hard as the circumstances are, there is no need to panic. And even if we have to take the ultimate step of a national shutdown, there will be no interruption of essential services. Access to food, pharmaceutical and other necessary supplies will be guaranteed."
"In short, Government and its partners will move heaven and earth to protect our Belizean people."
"Of course, we need your help; we need the cooperation and understanding of each and every Belizean. This crisis, like no other, demands a unity of effort, a spirit of collaboration, an overflow of fellow feeling and a pouring forth of all the reserves of national humanitarianism and patriotic solidarity."
Therefore:
Practice good personal hygiene;
Distance yourself socially for this crisis period;
Isolate yourself and report Corona symptoms to the health authorities;
"Adhere, without exception, to emergency and health guidelines; and, above all, be prepared to lend a helping hand to your neighbor, your friend, your fellow Belizean."
"I repeat, there is no need for panic. We don’t have to crowd the supermarkets and grocery stores because there is more than a sufficiency of necessary supplies. This will continue for as long as the pandemic lasts. Most important, there is great harm in spreading false rumors and certainly no benefit in stigmatizing persons that may become unwell."
"I ask you always to remember our advantages. Our small, dispersed population is spread over two cities, seven towns and over 200 villages. We are, therefore, blessed by a good degree of natural physical distancing. And our interconnectivity will allow for effective tracking and treatment in the eventuality of COVID clusters emerging."
"My message to you is, therefore, one of hope. But that is not to sell short the seriousness of the crisis. It will challenge our resilience. It will test our endurance."
"I have every confidence and not a single doubt, though, that this too shall pass; that we will once more emerge into our famed, golden, life-affirming Belizean sunlight; that we shall overcome; and that at the end of our trials we shall be once more grasping with both hands the overflowing cup that a beneficent Providence has always reserved for us. We are fortune’s child; and we will rebound to seize that special destiny marked by fate for this special land."
"Belize now and forever, God bless Belize."
Thank you.


"My Fellow Belizeans,"
"Last week, the Government announced additional measures to ramp up our fight against COVID-19. At Wednesday’s press conference I made clear that we were not then announcing a national shutdown. The circumstances at that time, in our view, did not yet warrant it. But I also made clear that we should prepare ourselves for just such an eventuality: that there were possible, indeed likely, developments that would act as triggers for a shutdown."
"As we all now know, yesterday, a Belizean that had returned from New York on March 20th, tested positive for the novel Coronavirus. That person claims to have been in self-isolation since his arrival back in Belize and was able to show health workers the contained and separate lower flat of the building in which his claimed isolation took place.  The individual, though testing positive, is exhibiting only mild symptoms and is not currently in need of hospitalization. Nevertheless, he is living in Belize City — home to the largest population concentration in our country. For the National Oversight Committee, and for the Cabinet of Belize, this is very significant. Clearly the crowds in the old capital make us more susceptible to widespread transmission. Thus, a comprehensive tracing of the afflicted individual’s possible contacts and a wider mapping exercise are both being done by the Ministry of Health team."
"In this connection, both the evidence from other countries and the advice from our own experts agree on one thing: the best way to at least slow, and hopefully stop, the spread of the virus, is by strictly enforcing the physical distancing, self-isolation, quarantining and other such rules. Even though we have already imposed a state of emergency for Ambergris Caye and passed two statutory instruments imposing penalties — including jail time for those that do not comply with the law — too many Belizeans are not taking the measures seriously enough. In all the circumstances, we consider it our duty now to do even more to prevent any chance of Belize City becoming an epicenter of COVID-19, indeed, to try to protect our entire country from the novel Coronavirus."
"Accordingly, I will be advising His Excellency the Governor General to declare a nationwide state of emergency for the country of Belize. This will go into effect at midnight on Wednesday, April 1st, and will include a curfew from 8:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. every day. The state of emergency is to last for 30 days in the first instance. For its duration people will be advised to shelter in place even during daylight hours and only to come out as absolutely necessary for purposes of procuring supplies, and doing such business and activities as are exigently required."
"Our National Task Force and our Caucus of CEOs have been planning for this eventuality for some time now. Nevertheless, and as we had promised, we are giving a couple of days’ notice for two reasons. Our people must have a chance to prepare for the new normal; and our officials must have a little more time to ensure that all systems are in place to guarantee the absolute availability of foodstuff and other critical supplies. The list of essential services and essential service workers is being finalized and their operational logistics are being fine-tuned."
"Tomorrow, we will be holding a press conference for only the media at the Laing Building at 10:00 a.m. There, we will go into all the details — medical, logistical and organizational — about the state of the emergency. We will, of course, answer all questions from the media."
I close by expanding on two things.
"First, I want to repeat what I said in last week’s address to the nation. This country is self-sufficient in basic staples and we can feed ourselves for the long haul. The continuity of essential services and the more than ample availability of supplies are both guaranteed and there is no need to panic."
"Supermarkets, grocery stores, banks and credit unions will all remain open and every arrangement is being made for local producers to proceed uninterrupted with the provision of meat, chicken, eggs, rice, beans, grains, vegetables and so on. Cargo will also continue to come into our country and essential imports are also secure."
"The second point I must make is this. Our local health team and the Ministry of Health are so plentifully resourced that we could theoretically reach the point of equipment oversupply. I hasten to add, though, that there can never really be too much   I’m just trying to underline the fact that we are completely prepared for the battle on the health front."
"So, the Ministry of Health costed the requirements for a six-month battle against COVID 19 at around 12 to 15 million dollars, Belize dollars. We already have in hand close to 20 million dollars and 13 million more is arriving from the IDB in a matter of weeks. Therein, though, lies the beginnings of a possible problem. All the International Financial Institutions, perhaps understandably, are laser focused on the health front of this fight against COVID-19. As critical as that is, though, what I keep telling our international partner is that it is equally important for us to feed and clothe our people; for us to take care of those now out of work and livelihood, unable to take care of themselves and their families."
"Government, as you know, is already borrowing 75 million from the Central Bank.  But this is a drop in the bucket. It is my solemn promise to you, however, that we will get more. I am in no doubt that we will end up at least doubling that 75 million dollars. Thus, there will be add-ons to the disbursement of money to our unemployed, which disbursements start this week and will also initially utilize the contributions made by BEL, BWSL and SSB. The additional funding that we will procure will augment the national ongoing BOOST Initiative that also already puts cash in the hands of our people; and we will also expand countrywide, including to the rural areas, the Ministry of Human Development’s all-important food assistance program."
"Belizeans: I say again that you are not alone. Together we will overcome.  And I swear by that Almighty God, whom I ask now to bless us all, that Government, our National Partnership, and I personally, will do everything to bring Belize as whole as possible out of this national and international nightmare."
I thank you.


"My Fellow Belizeans,"
"Earlier today, the Ministry of Health’s leadership team publicly announced the worrying news of test results having this morning   confirmed Belize’s fourth case of COVID-19."
"The infected person is from the Cayo District, but up until about 11 days ago, had been traveling to and from Belize City where he worked. He is in isolation at the Western Regional Hospital and the DHS and his team have already commenced their mapping and tracing exercise. Indeed, swabbing of contacts as a prelude to testing has already started; and the exercise includes coverage of the medical professionals involved in the treatment of the patient."
"In view of all this, my message today is for a two-fold purpose."
"It is clear now that the State of Emergency declaration and the shuttering of the country came not a moment too soon. Still, there are people insisting that we are overreacting in promoting some of the draconian measures contained in the revised statutory instrument signed last night by His Excellency the Governor General. I hope that this fourth case will help to persuade them of the absolute gravity of the situation."
"Accordingly, I also appeal to everyone not to try to beat the system. Stop trying — and here I pitch my petition to business owners and individuals — stop trying to find workarounds or opt-outs of the restrictions that force you to close and that limit your activities. I repeat that your movements must only be purpose-driven, confined to the reasons clearly listed in the Emergency Regulations."
"Travel across district lines is curtailed, and Easter is cancelled except, of course, as an opportunity for prayer, reflection, and virtual attendance at the religious services that our churches will live stream."
"You all know that our first two cases, one of which led to the infection of a third person, were imported. This fourth one seemingly was not. It, therefore, makes crystal clear the urgency of the heightened vigilance and protective measures that the State of Emergency is designed to achieve. And there is yet more to be done. In the result, I will now, after a word of explanation, announce an additional ramp-up to our Emergency Regulations."
"Some days ago, we notified of our decision to place all Belizeans entering or re-entering Belize, under a mandatory 14-day quarantine. Since that time around 19 Belizeans are now confined in Corozal Town at two facilities. Yet, they keep on coming. This is a stark reminder that our first two cases were brought in from L.A. and New York. The situation of Belizeans that have been in the U.S. and Mexico simply returning to the country willy nilly, cannot be allowed to continue. It leaves the door wide open to importation of the virus and this can upend all our war efforts against COVID-19."
"As a consequence, and after obtaining the unanimous support of the National Oversight Committee, the Government of Belize has decided that our borders are now to be closed even to Belizeans seeking to enter the country. Except in the case of those that are returning from travel for urgent medical attention or some other emergency purpose, no Belizean currently abroad can return to Belize. This prohibition will, in the first instance, last for the duration of the State of Emergency; and it will begin at 12:01 a.m. on Sunday, April 5th."
"It is, I readily admit, an extreme move. There is, however, no doubt that it has become necessary as we do everything to head off the swamping of our health system and the serious loss of life that the proliferation of the virus would entail. I, therefore, ask all Belizeans, and particularly those in the diaspora, for their understanding. This is the fight of our lives and I deliberately use the metaphor when I say that Belize must absolutely be placed on a war footing."
"Our new decision is, as we have checked and double-checked, entirely legal and grounded in the powers contained in the Constitution of the country and under the Governor General’s Emergency Proclamation. We shall therefore proceed and for the next 30 days our position is irreversible. That, however, is not all."
"The circumstances of the Cayo case make clear that the danger of extensive human-to-human transmission is now upon us. I, therefore, reserve the right to come back to you next week to announce even more stringent shutdown directives."
"Some businesses that escaped first round closure might find themselves included in a second round. Naturally, this would only happen after the National Oversight Committee meeting on Monday and consultation with Cabinet."
"I close by sharing some good news on the economic front. The application forms for those that have lost their jobs and are to be provided GOB relief are now available. In fact, there has already been a first rush of applications. The verification process is underway, and people should be seeing their money in the banks within two or so business days."
"Finally, OFID has confirmed its agreement to the reprogramming of 10 million Belize dollars from the infrastructure component of the Southside Poverty Alleviation Project. That money will now be used to augment our cash to the people program. Additionally, OFID is fast tracking approval for a new Belize loan in the amount of 20 million dollars. When all of this is placed in the pool of funds to come from the World Bank and the IDB, we are well on our way in the effort to leave no one behind in the exercise to cover comprehensively our unemployed and those struggling to feed themselves and their families."
"As always, then, together we do our best and together we shall prevail."
"Venceremos,"
And God bless Belize.


"My Fellow Belizeans,"
"It is my sad duty to announce the death this afternoon of the fourth patient to be diagnosed in Belize with COVID-19. On behalf of the entire nation, I offer deepest condolences to the wife and family of Hubert Pipersburgh. He was a well-known, indeed renowned, Belizean who served his country both at home and in the diaspora."
"Mr. Pipersburgh was diagnosed in San Ignacio early on Friday last, and was transferred to the KHMH that same evening. He was then intubated and appeared stable until today, when he deteriorated sharply. He died despite what I am assured were Herculean efforts on the part of the medical staff to save him."
"Mr. Pipersburgh’s death is an occasion for mourning. It is also a reminder, coming to us in the worst possible way, of the need for all Belizeans to treat this terrible virus with the grave seriousness it deserves. No one need doubt that such a reminder is necessary. Every day since the declaration of the state of emergency, the police have had to arrest scores of persons for breaking curfew and breaching the stay-at-home and social distancing regulations. The social media pictures of people piled almost on top of one another at the Michael Finnegan market in Belize City yesterday, are further and shocking proof of our heedlessness."
"I can only hope and plea that the tragic death of Mr. Pipersburgh, and the announcement early this morning of COVID-19’s fifth confirmed case in Belize, will cause the fundamental change in behavior that is a must if we are to defeat the pandemic."
"Of course, the Ministry of Health continues to work tirelessly to combat the spread of the virus. Very quickly after his diagnosis, close contacts of Mr. Pipersburgh, both in San Ignacio and Belize City where he worked, were swabbed and tested. That number amounted to 49. Additionally, 41 health care providers from the three medical facilities he visited were also tested. Thankfully, all tests have come back negative."
"The Ministry has also placed patient #5, a Belizean that a couple of days ago came back from the U.S. via Mexico, in strict quarantine. This was done in Corozal immediately upon his entry into the country, thus minimizing the possibility of any transmission from that patient."
"The point of rehearsing all this Ministry of Health activity is to reassure Belizeans. Tireless work is being done on the medical front, and there is no need to panic."
"The front line of the Ministry of Health has been strengthened by the recently arrived Cuban medical brigade. And I have directed the drafting of a number of non-government medical personnel, both doctors and nurses, to join an advisory, planning and coping unit to assist the Director of Health Services and his team."
"The National Oversight Committee meets virtually tomorrow and the same modality will now serve for Cabinet meetings. In that context, I expect an urgent analysis of the current medical situation and consideration of any further measures that may be necessary."
"I will report accordingly, and meantime, I thank you and ask God’s blessing on Belize."


"My Fellow Belizeans,"
"I need periodically to bring you up to date on our war against COVID-19, and it is for that purpose that I address you now. There are, of course, two basic fronts to our campaign: the medical and the socioeconomic."
"Regarding the medical, I am certain that we are making every effort to do the right thing. The nationwide lockdown is one sure way of helping to contain the spread of the virus. Accordingly, that lockdown will be made to run at least its 14-day course."
"The core medical team, tirelessly led by Dr. Marvin Manzanero, is receiving more expert support than ever. Several additional medical personnel have joined the National Task Force and have been given various critical assignments. Gaps and omissions are being addressed in as inclusive a manner as possible, in which connection the preliminary understanding reached with the KHMHA Union is key."
"Ample testing has always been our necessary objective, and a decisive increase is now in full flood. This has been made possible by the acquisition of a better than sufficient supply of test kits, accompanied as well by the procurement of more PPEs. We are therefore well-armed to pursue and try to control the Belize City and San Ignacio outbreaks, the COVID-19 clusters."
"I say again that we are as fortified as we can be in combating this most deadly and elusive of enemies. And I salute all those, especially the front line health and essential workers, that have been in the vanguard of our press against this demon foe."
"I also remind Belizeans, though, that you are the ground troops in this battle. So, hold the safety standard high. Wear your mask; practice good hygiene; adhere to social distancing; lend a hand to your neighbor; and please refrain from spreading rumors."
I turn now to the socioeconomic aspect of what is proving to be our long nightfall.
Our principal efforts here are twofold: to disburse all needed unemployment relief funds and to roll out an emergency countrywide food assistance program.
"We are in the middle of an economic shock the likes of which the modern world, let alone our beloved Belize, has never seen. Business activity has come almost to a halt, people have lost their jobs and livelihood, and revenue sources have dried up. The tax base has utterly eroded and we are terribly short of money. We are without coin of the realm and it is not possible to collect anything but a trickle. Still, Government must operate and the country must be kept going. We have to find salaries, especially for our doctors and nurses, our security forces, immigration and customs officers and all the public servants that keep the Administration operational. We must keep the lights on and the water flowing. We must pay for the PPEs and the testing kits and the Cuban brigade that has left their homeland to assist us."
"Above all, we must help our people, we must feed our people."
"It is an unprecedented challenge, it seems an impossible task. But it is one we go after with hands and heart, and we will prove equal to the job. Borrowing from our Central Bank, working with the international donor community, employing every resource we can, we WILL deliver to our citizens in need."
"As of today, then, 23,264 persons have already been approved for unemployment relief, and their payments sent to their banks. Ultimately, this particular safety net will cover upwards of 50 thousand persons."
"Likewise, 4,000 households, for a total of 17,000 beneficiaries, have received food baskets. This first tranche of that particular program is costing Government 12 million dollars."
"Now this unparalleled outreach in this unparalleled time has not been perfect. We wish that the money and the food could be more. We wish that the distribution process could be faster. But the shock to our lives, our economy, our systems, is like nothing any of us has ever witnessed. Everything has been shattered, our capacity is under the most unimaginable strain. And as has been demonstrated in even the great United States of America, it will take more than a day, a week, a month to put Humpty Dumpty together again."
"The unmistakable fact though, is that we will manage, that we are managing, this labor of Hercules. What we find for our people can by no means be a princely sum. We can’t give food baskets that are overflowing to excess. But no one will be left behind; no one will have to do without; everyone will get the basics; and all will be able to survive on what Government will provide."
"With the 75 million dollars borrowed from the Central Bank of Belize, we are able to help the unemployed for at least the next seven months. Furthermore, the pace of disbursements will continue to accelerate as we straighten out the processing kinks."
"Of course, no one knows how long this grim COVID reaper will be with us. But the Government, as the coverall for Belizeans, is in this for the long haul. The monies from the International Financial Institutions are taking some time to reach us, but they are coming. Thus, we expect at least 30 million dollars more for food assistance. And there should be 100 million dollars to augment our already existing BOOST program."
"Now BOOST is a form of cash transfer to the needy, and is separate and apart from the unemployment relief. As the 100 million dollars come in, people currently getting food assistance will be placed instead on BOOST. That is because the BOOST will last longer. With the cash transfer, they will then be able themselves to buy their food, and this will ease the distribution strain on the Ministry of Human Development. As well, the pre-existing food pantry program under which people paid a minimal amount, has now become completely free."
"The point is that Government is doing everything humanly possible, deploying every ingenuity so that — to repeat our mantra — absolutely no one will be left behind."
"These are the hardest of times. But all the details of the Government response that I have just gone into, are designed to make one thing crystal clear. There is no need for despair. No one need feel helpless. And that is because we that are called upon to do so, will take care of you. This is our sacred duty and one that we will discharge to the limit."
"I close by making one other promise to you. All that we do is without regard to color, red or blue. No politician of any stripe will get hands-on any GOB money, whether for unemployment relief or for food distribution. This is the way we have begun and this is the way we will continue."
"To those on both sides of the aisle that would have it otherwise, there is only one response. The nation comes first, and country over party every time."
Thank you.


"My Fellow Belizeans,"
I take this opportunity to update you on the most recent developments in our ongoing struggle against COVID-19.
"Thankfully, we are holding steady on the health front. Thus, there has been no new positive since Monday, April 13th. There were the two lamentable deaths; but no other of the 18 cases originally diagnosed is even in hospital. In point of fact, five are now pronounced as fully recovered, and all the others are at home recovering."
"The mapping and tracing exercises done in San Pedro, San Ignacio, Corozal and Belize City, are just about complete, but random sampling continues. Also, we expect this Saturday out of Miami a resupply of reagents that will enable us to proceed with the full scope of necessary testing. The fact is, though, that we appear for now to have contained the clusters that arose particularly in San Ignacio and Belize City. This, of course, is no reason to let our guard down. Indeed, the opposite is true and our health care professionals will try to build on their success."
"We have, since about a month ago, implemented the required measures to enforce social distancing, including constraints on business activity. Most recently, when our fear of Coronavirus spread was at its height, we actually enhanced our protective bulwarks. We did this by way of SI No. 55 of 2020, which came into effect at midnight on Holy Saturday. In consequence of that SI, there was the imposition of a complete Sunday lockdown, public transportation was brought to a halt, Government offices were closed to the public and additional private sector businesses were shuttered. Unless extended, these extra barriers were to last until April 25th, 2020, except for the Sunday lockdown. That was to remain until April 30th, the full life of the rest of SI 55."
"I am now able to declare officially that there will be no extension of the additional special buffers. They will, therefore, expire at midnight this Saturday."
"We feel able to mandate this relaxation, precisely because of the containment of the cluster spread. Thus, in-country public transportation by land, air and sea will resume for essential workers and essential purposes. Those passengers, though, whether on bus, boat or plane will be required to wear face masks. Government offices will reopen and those additional businesses placed on total cessation can go back to operating during limited hours. As well, the special Sunday quarantine will disappear."
"I repeat, however, that we are not flinging caution to the winds. So, after midnight on Saturday, all that will happen is that we will go back to the state of affairs that existed immediately prior to the inclusion of the additional measures in SI 55 of 2020. In other words, we will still be in lockdown mode though in a manner not quite as draconian as provided for by the additional special measures."
"For avoidance of any confusion, the Attorney General will make media appearances as soon as possible after this statement. He will remind of the details of SI 55 minus the special measures and will answer all questions in order to make the new position absolutely clear."
"And going forward, this is what will happen."
"The original State of Emergency Proclamation will itself expire on April 30th, 2020. An extension is clearly needed but that can only be done by way of a Resolution of the National Assembly. There will, therefore, be a meeting of the House on Monday coming, and a meeting of the Senate the following day. Those meetings are for the sole purpose of approving the State of Emergency extension, and physical attendance in the Chambers will be limited to the bare minimum of members needed to constitute a quorum. Once the extension of the State of Emergency is approved by Parliament, a new SI will be drafted for the signature of the Governor General."
"The National Oversight Committee is currently being advised by the National Task Force, the economic czars and the Health Team as to further relaxations that the new SI could safely permit."
"The point is that we are looking at the commencement of a phased, calibrated restart of business and economic activity in Belize."
"I repeat, that this will have to be a finely balanced exercise, especially since we cannot discount the possibility of a Coronavirus second wave. To underscore that, the National Assembly is being asked for a two-month extension of the State of Emergency; so, there will be an easing of rigor in the new regulations coming into force on May 1st, 2020.  However, it will be to a studiously calculated degree as we continue to treat the preservation of life and health as our first priority."
"In this regard, I wish again to salute all those on the front lines of this Coronavirus battlefield. I also wish to thank the Belizean people for their understanding, forbearance and the spirit of cooperation that has been in evidence since the start of the crisis. I reiterate the need for us to maintain strict adherence to social distancing and personal hygiene, as well as that good neighborliness that I just commended."
"The two key citizen support programs, unemployment relief and food assistance, are proceeding apace. I thus record that as of this morning 33,771 persons had been approved for the jobless benefits, with actual payouts to 23,680 of them; and 8,017 households of 32,871 individuals have received grocery baskets. This is in addition to the 4,000 households that get pantry under that preexisting, long-standing initiative."
"In light of all the advances we are steadily making, I wish to close on a note of confidence. I, therefore, restate my unshakable conviction that this fight against COVID-19 is one that we can win, one that we WILL win."
Thank you.


"Today, May 1st, 2020, we in Belize join the rest of the world in commemorating International Workers’ Day and applauding the tireless work of our people."
"Indeed, in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, saying thank you to all workers has very special meaning, especially for our frontline workers who are providing health care and public health surveillance, as well as other essential service workers at the supermarkets, banks, gas stations, government ministries and agencies, utility companies, and all others who provide you and your loved ones with a needed service."
"Since the coronavirus was identified in December 2019, the World Health Organization has advised that as of April 29, 2020, there have been 2,954,222 confirmed cases and 202,597 deaths globally. Here in Belize, we have had 18 confirmed cases and 2 deaths and, even though there have been no new confirmed cases for over a week, we have to remain vigilant and continue to observe the laws and the protocols that are ensuring that we can contain the spread of COVID-19, especially as we prepare for the eventual slow and gradual re-opening of our economy.  We must always pay attention to the public health specialists in the Ministry of Health who will continue to monitor and report on developments."
"The International Labour Organization has reported that since the outbreak of the coronavirus, there has been and continues to be a drastic reduction in working hours globally to the extent that half of the global workforce is expected to have their livelihoods severely impacted. In Belize, we estimate that approximately half of the work force will be affected in terms of job security.  Information so far suggests that unemployment has already doubled and over 20,000 workers in tourism and related businesses have already been laid off or are on the verge of being laid off.  Suppliers to tourism have all seen demand for their products and services disappear overnight and, as a result, many workers in agriculture, arts and craft, music and entertainment, other cultural services, and transportation by land, sea and air have also seen their jobs put on hold."
"My fellow Belizeans, these public health and economic challenges are enormous, and labour has been affected in unprecedented ways. Many workers have been experiencing major transformations in the way they do their work.  Many are working from home, using information and communication technology at a pace and depth they have never had to before.  As many more businesses seek to use these technologies directly in the production of goods and services, the working environment will continue to change and transform as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves here in Belize and globally.  Many of these new ways of working will stay with us even after the pandemic recedes."
"The Ministry of Labour continues to engage and consult with our trade unions, employers and other stakeholders, one-on-one and at a national level, providing the best advice and support that we can. This is critical because all of us are working towards one shared goal, which is to protect all workers, as by doing so we protect families, communities, and by extension, our country."
"As the state of emergency moves into a new phase on May 1st, there are some changes in the designation of essential services and approved businesses.  But one thing will remain with us:  our workers, our employers, and all Belizeans will need to continue to practice physical distancing and good hygiene practices and to heed the advice of the Ministry of Health and the public health agencies."
"Employers, we urge you to put in place the necessary “return to work” protocols and procedures to protect your workers and the public as we bring businesses back to life. You will be required to ensure that the necessary physical distancing protocols are in place within your working environments and as your workers increasingly provide services to the public in the weeks ahead.  You will be required to ensure that sanitization   washing of hands and cleaning of workspaces   is constant; and that workers are provided with and properly use their masks.  We also ask you to remain mindful of the mental and psychosocial health challenges of your employees and seek to provide them with the support needed."
"In the Ministry, we are continuing our efforts, as a part of government and with our national and international partners, to bring on stream programmes that will present new job opportunities as well as resources for social support and employment relief programmes for persons both in the formal and informal sectors."
"I want to close by extending my personal gratitude to every person and to every organization that has extended a hand of kindness and goodwill to make things better for a worker or neighbour or a member of the community in need during this COVID-19 crisis. It is this spirit of caring for each other, positivity, love and willingness to put all our creative energy to work through the most difficult national crisis, that will ensure that we will see the economy revive, businesses return and new businesses emerge with even greater success and more decent jobs available for our workers."
Happy Labour Day to all and may God continue to bless Belize.


"Today marks something of a milestone in our national campaign against COVID-19. The first state of emergency (SOE) proclaimed by His Excellency the Governor General expires at midnight tonight; and this is also, I believe, the 17th straight day that we have gone without recording any new positive case. We, therefore, are turning a corner and at 12:01 a.m. on Friday, May 1st, a new, or extended, state of emergency goes into effect."
"That means, there will be in effect a new proclamation issued by the Governor General. Thereunder, there will also be a new statutory instrument (SI), with new regulations that His Excellency will also sign into law. The new state of emergency and the new regulations will, as mandated by the National Assembly, last for 60 days unless sooner revoked by parliament."
"The principal reason for this press conference is to sketch for you the changes that the new regulations will effect. I use the word sketch advisedly. All I will do is to highlight some of the new features that the new regulations will usher in. Later on today, it is the Attorney General that will walk the public step by step through every provision of the new statutory instrument. That statutory instrument will, of course, also be available on various GOB websites and generally on social media."
"In parliament, and elsewhere, I had made the point that there was no need to fear that the extension of the state of emergency necessarily meant the extension of the regime, in all its rigour, that existed under the previous state of emergency. In fact, I signaled that given how comparatively well we are doing in keeping new cases at bay, we expected to relax the strictness of the last set of regulations. I am, therefore, here to tell you that it is precisely as I intimated: there is a substantial easing that the new regime will bring. I am also pleased to be able to say that the new measures are the product of an agreement between both the National Oversight Committee and the Cabinet of Belize."
"Before I go any further, I must make one thing clear. There is no way that, in those famous words of President Bush, that we can declare “mission accomplished”. We see what is to happen now as a breathing space, a somewhat uneasy truce. We will use the opportunity to plan, to prepare for the distinct possibility of a second wave of cases. If that hits, we ask our people to be ready to do it all over again, including returning to the most draconian of lockdowns."
"One of the worst things about this virus is that nobody in the world has been able to figure out exactly how it works. It is an unpredictable, insidious enemy that can double back on itself and quickly upend whatever progress we initially make. This is a long-haul struggle and we will no doubt have to make long-haul sacrifices."
"For now, though, we believe we have caught a little bit of a break, however short-lived it may prove. We, therefore, seize the opportunity to restart, to the maximum degree possible in the circumstances, internal business and economic activity."
"Accordingly, under the new SI, all government departments and all statutory bodies will reopen on Monday, May 4th. We have, naturally, added to the list of approved private sector businesses also permitted to operate; and those add-ons can actually begin on Saturday, May 2nd   after the Labour Day holiday   if they normally employ Saturday opening hours. Lawyers, accountants, real estate brokers, are some examples of private sector, professional service providers that are now on the approved list. There is, as well, a category compendiously described as local manufacturers, under which our carpenters, building contractors, plumbers, electricians, and so on, will also be able to operate. The wholesalers and retailers generally are being freed up, and even call centers can reopen, particularly for training purposes. Belize call center services are increasingly in demand as a result of the pandemic, and the centers can take on well over a thousand new hires if training is allowed. Very very significant for the economy."
"Hotels will also now reopen, if they so choose, to cater to a Belizean clientele. Their restaurants will be limited, though, to providing room service and take-out meals."
"As a result of all this, the general restriction on movement is being lifted to the extent that it will now permit the public to attend at the various government and private businesses for such services as they require, in addition to the purchase of supplies and essential needs. And in one more concession, beauty salons and barbershops can also resume operations, although, only by appointment basis, dealing with one customer at a time. Spas, I am afraid, will still have to remain closed."
"There is much more to the statutory instrument than I have outlined, but as I said, I leave the detailed, line by line exegesis to the Attorney General, whom you will see later today."
"I, therefore, have only one other thing to add in this regard. The relaxation, the opening up, is not a free for all. Every business activity, all economic operations, are subject to the social distancing requirements. No public establishment can suffer any member of the public to enter its premises without wearing a face mask, and managers and staff must themselves wear the masks. Also, none can operate without putting in place the six-foot dividers to keep both staff and the public properly spaced apart."
"It is then, critically important for us to grasp that ultimately everything depends on our observing the physical distancing and other rules. Thus, it is that we are actually increasing the penalties for particular breaches. As just one example, those caught using the illegal crossings to go especially into Mexico and Quintana Roo, where the proliferation of coronavirus cases has skyrocketed, will, upon conviction, go straight to jail for three months. A second conviction will result in a one-year prison sentence."
"I wish to stress again that this breather that we are taking is an opportunity to ramp up our defenses for the possible second wave. Key to that strategy is continued testing. It is for that reason that CEO Dr. Gough is here. He will go over our inventory of tests and accompanying supplies that are in hand, and what is on order. This is for one overriding reason: transparency. You must know our state of readiness. You must know of any shortcomings and what we are doing to fix those. You must know what money has been spent and how it has been spent. You must know our funding sources and what has been promised versus what has been received."
"Before I turn it over to Dr. Gough, I will say one last thing. We are all hoping soon for the internationally certified rapid tests that will help us to do two things: increase our own local testing capacity, and enable us effectively to test visitors so that we can reopen our all-important tourism industry."
"In the meantime, though, let us understand something. We will never be able to test every single Belizean. Furthermore, the science suggests that that is simply not necessary. What the international benchmarks, from WHO and others, say is that there is no exact number of tests to aim for. The guiding principle, rather, is this: you want a low percentage of your tests to come back negative, around 10% or even lower, says William Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard. This is because if a high percentage of tests comes back positive it is clear there is not enough testing to capture all of the infected people in the community. The lower the percentage of tests you are doing that comes back positive, the better. By that standard, Belize with only the cases that we have documented from over 700 tests, is doing well percentage-wise. We are certainly well below that 10% positive benchmark that signals the need for greatly accelerated testing."
"Also, at the beginning of an outbreak where the number of people infected with the virus is low, a much smaller number of tests is needed to accurately assess the spread of the virus. As the virus infects more people, testing coverage needs to expand in order to provide a reliable number of the true indication of infected people."
"All that notwithstanding, Belize is moving on with increased testing as Dr. Gough, to whom I now turn, will also explain."


"Good morning, members of the media. Good morning, members of the public,"
"I want to give you an update on the state of play regarding our COVID-19 struggles. Before I do so, though, allow me the opportunity to express my best wishes for a speedy recovery for the Right Honourable Said Musa, the ex-Prime Minister of Belize. I understand that he was last night admitted to hospital having suffered what was described as a mild stroke. I’m sure that I join all other Belizeans in wishing him a speedy and complete recovery."
"Now in terms of what I propose for this morning, I will make my initial presentation after which the good Dr. Gough will give you an overview of our supplies inventory and our testing trajectory. After that, of course, both of us will take the media’s questions."
"Now, as you know, there is still no new confirmed COVID-19 case and Monday will be the 28th day, we will reach that 28thday marker, providing this position of no new positive holds through this weekend. If it does so, and we do reach that 28-day milestone, we can promise you a further relaxation of some of the remaining restrictions."
"The National Oversight Committee will meet as usual on Monday, followed by Cabinet on Tuesday. They will be asked now to provide for greater cross district movement, particularly so as to enable a domestic tourism push. The hotels, as you know, have already been given permission to reopen, but now we would expressly provide for the ability of local guests at our hotels to be able to enjoy the amenities, including the pool, including walking along the beach, and including swimming in the sea. Of course, the social distancing requirements will remain in place so that group swimming and group strolling, if you will, will still be prohibited."
"This domestic tourism push naturally raises the issue of our opening up to foreign tourism. We are clearly not there yet and my best guess, my personal best guess, is not before July. That, I would like to note, is also the position of CARICOM as discussed in a virtual meeting of heads that took place earlier this week. I do want to make clear, though, that I have never said that the opening of our borders will have to wait on a vaccine. That is the stance of some countries, our ally Taiwan being one such. It is not my position though. While ultimately it depends on the National Oversight Committee and the Cabinet, my own view is this. We must remember that the virus, in some countries, has a mortality rate that is as high as 12%. Before we reopen, we therefore must look at the trajectory of the virus in North America as a whole and the US in particular. After all, the US is our biggest tourism market, responsible for over 75% of our tourism flows. As long as the rates of infection in the US have not plateaued, we would best beware. Also, we hope for, though not necessarily wait upon, an effective treatment for those that become critically ill after contracting the virus. What of course could allow us to hurdle both the barriers I have just referred to is the availability of an effective rapid test. That latter seems to be getting closer and closer, hence my own reason for feeling that we could be good to go possibly by as early as July. The ability to immediately test tourists on arrival should be an open sesame. It is not a failsafe, but we clearly, as always, have to juggle saving lives with safeguarding the economy. A rapid test would permit us to let in all tourists that test negative upon arrival. The fact that one or two could nevertheless thereafter still contract the virus is, in my view, an acceptable risk. So it is that reliable rapid test that would be the best trigger for the much longed for tourism reopening."
"Even before the return of the tourists, we must prepare for the return of those Belizeans that have been stranded abroad. Thus, we have already activated plans for their repatriation. They will, of course, have to go into quarantine. We wish to begin the process of letting our nationals back in as early as possible. It would clearly be before the mass marketing of satisfactory rapid tests. And that is why we will therefore have to carefully manage the flow of our returnees since we can’t handle the quarantining of excessively large numbers if everybody sought to come back at the same time. But I expect the details of the logistics, being worked on even now, to be publicized immediately after next week’s meetings."
"The Unemployment Relief Program continues and the current numbers show that over 40,000 persons have now been approved. Similarly, the food assistance is ongoing and 23,913 households, or 91,052 individuals, have now been serviced. On the other hand, still not one dollar has arrived of what has been promised by the International Financial Institutions. They do insist, though, that the funds will ultimately come. Indeed, the IDB says it expects to disburse by month’s end the 12 million BZ for the Ministry of Health. Meantime of course we have already spent 6.2 million dollars on procurement of supplies to fight COVID-19."
"Now, at this point I need, unfortunately, to say something about the impasse between Government and the PSU. The other two unions have not made clear their particular positions so I need to concentrate especially on the PSU. There’s this stalemate between us over our proposals that public officers should forgo increments for this fiscal year 2020/2021. Also, that senior public officers should agree to a reduction in certain of their allowances; and finally, that there is to be a withholding of a portion of gratuity and allowances for all contract officers including, of course, the chief executive officers."
"These measures are absolutely necessary but in fact they are woefully insufficient. Here is why. A snapshot of the current financial picture looks like this. For the month of April 2020 collections of business tax and GST together were just 48% of what was collected in April 2019. This decrease was from 45.8 million dollars in April 2019 to only 21.8 million dollars in April 2020. Remember too that these taxes are paid in arrears, so to speak. So, the April 2020 collections relate principally to March 2020 business activity. March was, of course, before the lockdown. The point being, that this May month’s 2020 collections relating to April 2020 business activity, when the lockdown was in full effect, will see an even more precipitous fall. The projection, in fact, is that April’s fall to 21.8 million dollars will drop further to only 11.2 million dollars in May. Now consider further that Customs and Excise also fell in April 2020 to 20 million dollars. That was a 10 million dollar drop over April 2019. Again, the Customs revenue was principally for goods ordered before the lockdown. The same pattern therefore as with business tax and GST, will be repeated with respect to the Customs revenues. Accordingly, the reduction in goods ordered after the start of the lockdown this past month, will see a further fall in Customs collections in May 2020. Consider finally that the Government’s monthly wage bill is 45 million dollars. That means that the 41.2 million collected from business tax, GST and Customs in April could not meet that 45-million-dollar monthly wage bill. The story still does not end there because there are, of course, Government’s other operating expenses. These include debt service, utilities, supplies, fuel, and capital spending; and they amount to another 45 million dollars for a total Government of Belize monthly outlay of 90 million dollars. But, I repeat, we only collected 41.2 million dollars in April and expect no more than 30 million altogether in May. I am reminded of Mr. Micawber’s famous words in Dickens’s David Copperfield. It is in that context that the GOB proposal, requiring the most minimal of sacrifices from those paid from the public purse, must be seen. All we are asking is that public officers and teachers give up increments for fiscal year 2020/2021. In the case of heads of departments and other senior public officers, they have reached the top of their scales and so they get no increments. Accordingly, they are being asked to give up half of their entertainment allowances. CEO’s are to sacrifice five percent of their gratuity and a portion of their allowances. And all other contract officers are similarly to give up some gratuity and some allowances. Ministers have forgone one month’s salary and 800 dollars monthly in allowances. Thus, the increment freeze group is, in dollar terms, being asked for the smallest amount of all. So, the public officers, like the teachers, are to give least of all Government of Belize employees. Now you have heard me say publicly that I will do my damndest not to ever touch the substantive salaries of the teachers and public officers. So, there is that assurance and there is in consequence only a minuscule ask of increments and, for seniors, some allowances. In the circumstances I am utterly confounded by the intransigence of particularly the PSU. Private sector jobs have been decimated by the pandemic. In excess of 80,000 persons have had to apply for unemployment relief. The plight of all those without even food is horrendous. So, GOB has been obliged, even in the face of the revenue collapse, to hear their cry and to roll out assistance to them. The IDB has just confirmed that of all tourism dependent economies in the world Belize is the third worst hit. But in the middle of this widespread social and economic devastation, in the face of the well over 80,000 persons without jobs and wherewithal, Government of Belize still insists on protecting the substantive salaries of public officers. That notwithstanding, they refuse to make even the tiny sacrifice we are asking. I say without reservation their position is unacceptable. They do have a proud tradition of sacrifice but they are demeaning it now by their unreasonableness. Everybody else must suffer, everybody else must sacrifice, but not them. It is utterly incomprehensible and Government won’t have it. When we go to the Central Bank of Belize to borrow the huge amounts that are necessary to pay the public officers, we to some extent crowd out the private sector. Yet the private sector is uncomplaining. So, if the PSU persists in refusing even the measly contribution we are requiring, I don’t see how responsible public opinion can allow them to get away with it. Government won’t allow them to get away with it. What we put to them will save only 17 million dollars all told. That is a drop in the bucket given that we are looking at a larger than 450 million-dollar, pandemic-induced recurrent revenue shortfall for this fiscal year. That’s almost half of the projected revenue collection. This situation, I repeat, cannot be countenanced and Government of Belize is going to do what we must. The PSU talks about going to Court. Well, I will remind them that no court can oblige the Government to pay what it simply does not have. But enough said on that and I apologize that it has detracted so damagingly from the fight and the unity effort required to bring us to safe harbor."
"Let me, with relief then, turn now to two straightforward announcements. The Queen’s Birthday Ceremonies, scheduled for this 24th of May, are being cancelled. On the upside, we expect, on Monday, to receive proposals for a phased reopening of our churches and places of worship."
"One final matter. The question has been raised of how employers are to treat those employees that were laid off for the comparatively short period of the intense lockdown but are in some cases now going back to work. The Ministry of Labour announces that it stands ready to advise on a case by case basis. But as a general rule, we hope for their employment to be treated as continuous so as not to prejudice their entitlements on retirement or final severance."
Let me now thank you and turn it over to Dr. Gough before we both take your questions.


"Today marks Belize’s 31st day without anyone testing positive for the novel Coronavirus. We, therefore, are holding steady at 18, the total number of persons to have been infected in our country. Of these, very sadly two have died. But all the others have recovered. So that Belize is now one of only 12 countries and territories in the entire world to be currently COVID-19 free.  That is quite an achievement, and I want immediately to congratulate all Belizeans, but in particular, to single out the essential service workers, all essential workers, and in particular, of course, the frontline workers   doctors, the nurses, all the medical personnel."
"So, while this is quite an achievement, it is not cause to declare victory. The science and the experts, including our own Dr. Manzanero, warn us of the folly, indeed the danger, of any such rashness. And the experience of other countries provides clear examples of how easily things can change; the possibility of regression; the rapidity with which a second wave could overtake us."
"I do not want to be a killjoy. Our relative success so far is a reason for thanksgiving, but it must not occasion carelessness or any false sense of security. Precisely that, however, seems to be occurring. Every time we announce any relaxation of our still stringent measures, we at the same time issue strong warnings."
"Nevertheless, too many people seem to misinterpret the easing of restrictions as a free pass to completely violate the other important prohibitions that very much remain in place."
I repeat: this ordeal is by no means over and lax or knowing avoidance of the subsisting guardrails is the surest way of taking us back to ground zero.
"Thus, even as I proceed now to sketch the newly agreed steps to ameliorate the lockdown, I implore our people not to see this as carte blanche for reckless or heedless behavior."
"So, now to the changes that are being made to the SI currently in force."
"Last week I referred to the fact that the BTB had approached us about a domestic tourism push. Hotels had already been reopened but questions had arisen about two things: use of hotel pools and beaches; and use of hotel restaurants. The National Oversight Committee, supported by Cabinet, has now decided that use of pools, use of the sea (or rivers in the case of inland resorts) is to be permitted. As always, this is subject to social distancing."
"Regarding hotel restaurants, the last position was that they could only offer room service or take-out food. The new arrangements will permit eating at the restaurants so long as those restaurants have outdoor seating facilities. Again, social distancing will obtain so that tables will be six feet apart and not more than 10 persons are to be accommodated at any one time."
"Cabinet recognized that charges of discrimination could arise if we did not do for restaurants, generally, what we are doing for hotel restaurants. Accordingly, all open-air restaurants in the country will be allowed to reopen once the amended SI comes into effect. I need to stress again, though, that the social distancing prescriptions will still apply. Indeed, the National Task Force is developing   in fact, completing today   a set of written protocols to guide these restaurants on how properly to operate while still social distancing."
"Using the same non-discrimination principle, the general public will now be able to go swimming in our rivers and seas. We can’t, for local tourism purposes, encourage it at resorts, but continue to outlaw it generally. So subject to separation, spacing and the cap on the number of persons that can gather in any one place, Belizeans will be able, once again, to enjoy our aquatic wonders."
"Our Doctor Manza, as some of you know, is quite the jogger. So, he certainly sympathized with his fellow aficionados that complained about the difficulties of face mask running. The medical literature bears out the thesis that the masks are not necessary for outdoor exercising. Accordingly, that requirement has been shelved, and so, the “keep fit” people can now literally breathe easier."
"Churches can now hold services at their physical facilities, though subject to the 10-person limit. Depending on our continued anti-Corona progress, we should raise that threshold in the next couple of weeks."
"The legal return of Belizeans, including students, that want to be repatriated, is now to begin. Those wishing to come home should write to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or our embassies and consulates indicating how and when they would like to arrive. The flow will clearly have to be managed   we can’t have everybody come back at once   and all returnees will be subject to a mandatory 14-day quarantine. Now, the Belizean border jumpers will continue to face criminal charges but they too will be quarantined before their trial can even begin. They will be swabbed even before they’re taken to court to be arraigned, and after arraignment, if they’re given bail, they still go back into quarantine. If they’re given bail, they go back into quarantine, and at the end of the 14 days, those that have not been given bail will be transferred to the Central Prison."
"Discussion of this new phase in the easing of restrictions naturally begs the multi-million-dollar question: when will our borders reopen and when, in particular, will the PGIA recommence operations?"
"I’m afraid I have no comprehensive answer to give, but I can say this much. We are contemplating special and differential treatment for the PGIA, with the hope that general entry into Belize by air can begin even before entry by land and sea. Thus, a July 1st re-start for international flights is the fervent hope of us all. Indeed, it has been the trigger for contingency tourism planning that is now well advanced.  Unfortunately, however, we must concede the distinct possibility of a push back. Unless, for instance, either a rapid test is available for us to screen visitors or those visitors can produce a satisfactory passport immunity certificate, it is difficult to see how we could proceed. Otherwise, we will run unacceptable risks that could result in undoing all we have so far been able to achieve in this extended anti-Coronavirus campaign."
The uncertainty is most regrettable but having to deal with moving targets is one of the core problems of the pandemic.
"I wind up on this first aspect of today’s brief by confirming that the idea is to have the amended SI come into effect this Friday, May 15th. The drafting is taking place even now and the AG will tomorrow, in his usual inimitable style, go through the final and authoritative version."
"Let me turn now to the question of the meeting that I had yesterday morning with the Association of Public Service Senior Managers, the Public Service Union and the Belize National Teachers Union."
"We had, I thought, reached agreement subject only to ratification by the Unions’ general membership. My CEO took copious notes, careful notes, and at the end, recited for the Unions GOB’s final proposed position. That was what I thought they agreed. We reduced that oral agreement to writing and the Financial Secretary sent it off to the Unions. Lo and behold, though, this morning we got a response from the President of the BNTU, speaking as well for the PSU though not the APSSM, and that response asked that some critical words be changed. Such changes would, in my view, greatly alter the spirit of the agreement and are, therefore, not acceptable to Government. The Financial Secretary is in the process of writing back to the two unions; so, we will return to square one unless they accept in essence the language that was orally agreed yesterday."
"But I repeat: it cannot be that we continue to haggle over the sacrifice we are asking of the two Unions.  APSSM has already agreed. The bigger picture is that their substantive salaries and job security are being pretty much guaranteed notwithstanding the Government’s revenue collapse. In the private sector, no class of workers has been so exempt, and very many thousands of people have lost their entire livelihoods. In the circumstances, what we are asking of the PSU and BNTU is very reasonable, too reasonable some would say."
"But the idea is not to quarrel. It is to say rather, that the demonstration effect of the Unions’ acceptance or non-acceptance is a public opinion hinge issue. Regarding its core position on this matter, therefore, Government is unbending."
I believe that the blockage situation at the Western Border is resolved and I would be happy to expand on this as we move now to the question and answer session.
Thank you.


"Good morning, members of the media. Good morning, members of the public."
"My fellow Belizeans,"
"Welcome to this morning’s press conference, and, forgive me, but I must start this morning on a note of complaint. Today’s press conference is another in what has become a regular, almost weekly series. The objective is always to update the nation in as comprehensive a manner as possible on where we are in the ongoing struggle to keep our country free from the novel Coronavirus. I try, by way of these briefings, to speak to both health sector and economic sector developments. I always come to you armed with material from Cabinet and from the apex National Oversight Committee. My aid in addressing you and answering your questions is the official notes of the deliberations of both bodies. Those notes help me to report accurately to you since, for the sake of transparency, fidelity to the record is essential. I was, therefore, distressed to learn yesterday that someone, not the official minutes keeper, had circulated his or her own version of the NOC discussions and decisions. That was wrong and a breach of confidentiality. Furthermore, the error was compounded by the fact that what was released was, in a number of instances, terribly inaccurate. I express the earnest hope that it won’t happen again."
"Turning now to the Ministry of Health’s Coronavirus dashboard, you all know that we continue to be free of any active case. I, therefore, offer the customary, but always heartfelt, thanks to all our essential workers."
"As of Wednesday, we had done 1,517 tests. There were five results still pending, with all others being negative except for the 18 you have long since known about. We continue to test on an average of three times per week. The fact that now we don’t test as often as we once did has nothing to do with what that distorted report falsely described as a decision to conserve on supplies. Rather, it is that all the science, according to our Director of Health Services, proves that in our current circumstances testing of asymptomatic people is a low yield exercise. Accordingly, our present test level is entirely satisfactory of World Health Organization standards."
"On the economic front you already, I believe, have the press release sent out yesterday updating the status of the Unemployment Relief Program. This shows that 43,726 applications have been approved to date. SSB has processed all those approvals and 94% or 40,927 of them were successfully paid. The rest is so far unpayable because the bank information of the applicants was either not submitted or the information they sent was inaccurate. Regarding the Food Assistance Program, these are the numbers: 46,686 households have been helped and now the on-the-ground assessment has been completed in 38 rural villages in Toledo, Cayo, and Orange Walk. Those people are beginning at this point to be helped."
"Concerning what we are expecting from the International Financial Institutions, it is true that we are still in waiting mode. It is not true, though, that, as the inaccurate so-called notes state, no international funding will come in for the month of June. In fact, the first disbursement of the US 6.2 million dollars from the IDB is to arrive right after the bank’s June 3rd signature of the amended loan contract. The other IDB line of US 12 million dollars is scheduled to be approved formally on June 20th; and the processing of the World Bank’s 21 million US dollars is also to be completed in the latter half of next month, of June. There is US 50 million dollars more to be had from the World Bank, but those particular disbursements indeed won’t happen before July."
"Now Wednesday’s meeting of the National Oversight Committee did agree with Cabinet on the further easing that is to take place as internally we proceed with the reopening of our economy. In dealing in some detail with the relaxation of the state of emergency measures, I sound the usual caution. Please do not interpret the further lifting of restrictions as a free for all. I get it, that people are stir crazy, but we cannot afford to move too fast. I, therefore, ask again for strict observance of such safety protocols as do remain in place."
"The amended S.I. to reflect the changes is being drafted. In fact, I believe the A.G. and the SolGen finished this morning. I was sent a copy but I have not had time to check it. What I tell you, then, is subject to changes, albeit, at the most, slight changes. In any case, that amended S.I. would take effect at 12:01 a.m. this Monday, June 1st. By that I mean that when you wake up Monday morning, the S.I. would be extant and would usher in the following."
"The number allowed for gatherings with social distancing will increase from 10 to 40. In particular, our places of worship with the requisite space will be able, physically, to host congregations of that size."
"Tacos and other street vendors can get back to business, but will need to comply with certain sanitary protocols. Those protocols are being finalized and will be handed to those who have emerged as the leaders of the street vendor community between today and tomorrow."
"The permission to operate already given to open air restaurants will now be extended to all restaurants. This, again, is on condition that the physical distancing and other rules will still apply."
"The sale of Boledo, much anticipated at least in some quarters, will restart and casinos will also be allowed to be reopened. Neither smoking nor alcohol consumption is to be allowed in the casinos."
"Approval is being given for gyms in accordance with the strict guidelines ratified by the NOC. In accordance with those guidelines, gyms can now reopen."
"All non-contact open air sports are to be permitted for practice and exercise purposes, and, in fact, exercise hours are no longer restricted to the 5:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. time slot. Sport fishing is also allowed."
"General curfew hours are being broadened only for Fridays and Saturdays. Thus, on those two days, curfew will be from 9:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. All other days will remain at 8:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. The children’s curfew stays generally at 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m., but minors can move about from 5:00 a.m. up to 8:00 p.m. on weekdays and 9:00 p.m. on weekends if, and only if, they are accompanied by a responsible adult."
"As a result of those unofficial, leaked NOC notes, much confusion has arisen surrounding the holding of graduation ceremonies. The true position is this. Both Cabinet and the NOC received a proposal from the Belize High School regarding a particular mode for their particular ceremony. Acceptance of the proposal would have meant agreeing to breach the numbers cap of 10, now 40, on gatherings. Although both Cabinet and the NOC felt that what the Belize High School was proposing could be safely done, there was also a worry that permission to BHS could be seen as preferential treatment. Ultimately, the NOC asked that the Ministry of Education consult with all the principals of our high schools. The Ministry is to find out how the other high schools are planning graduation ceremonies that conform to the social distancing protocols and what the other principals think of the BHS proposal. There is, thus, no effort to impose any one size fits all template on the high schools. This is an information gathering exercise that will help in making a final decision regarding BHS. In fact, just before I set out this morning to come here, I had a message from the Minister of Education, and, if I can recollect correctly what he told me, it is this. All the principals have their individual plans for how they will conduct their graduation exercises, their graduation ceremonies, but they all say they are doing it in a way that will conform to the social distancing requirements. They say, again as I understand it from the Minister, that it is fine then for Belize High School to proceed on exactly that same basis. We will distill this information at Monday’s NOC meeting, but I gather that the BHS principal has already been informed of what the result of the Minister’s consultation with the other school principals is."
"With that I conclude my sketch of the new rules, allowing me now to come to that extremely important matter of the reopening of our borders generally and the PGIA in particular. Of course, the Attorney General will tomorrow at 3:00 p.m. take to the “Ask the Experts” program and, in what is his now customary fashion, go through the S.I. line by line for the benefit of the public. Take the final position from him, because I have, as I said, talking to you now, not been able to go through the draft, and so what I am giving you are the highlights, which won’t change. They might be added to, but remember that I content myself with just this sketch of the major points constituting the changes that the S.I. will promote now."
"So, this question of the external reopening, I make clear at once that an early loosening of the entry prohibition at our land borders was never on the cards. That is because, in only the last week, the number of COVID-19 cases has surged in the countries surrounding us:"
"Mexico went up by 25% from 56,000 to 75,000"
"Guatemala by 80% from 2,200 to 4,000"
"Honduras by 50% from 3,000 to 4,400"
"El Salvador from 1,600 to 2,100."
"In the case of Mexico, questions have arisen as to whether there is underreporting. That notwithstanding, Mexico is now globally the 17th most infected out of 200 countries and territories."
"It is in that context that we agreed that there would likely be a considerable wait before we could unseal our land borders. On the other hand, there has been the most anxious, searching, and intense debate at both NOC and Cabinet over a possible standalone reopening of the PGIA. It is no secret that we have, since around a month ago, been aiming for a July 1st recommencement of operations at our only international airport. Indeed, by majority vote at both the Cabinet and the NOC, the decision was made to confirm that July 1st date, subject to certain conditions being put in place."
"It surely is not hard to understand why we so ardently wished for a go at the PGIA. Tourism is our largest job creator and the biggest contributor to GDP and foreign exchange earnings. In 2019, for example, total tourism expenditure in Belize was 502.3 million US dollars. But COVID-19 is decimating the industry. The devastation is such that between January and April of this year, tourist spending in Belize fell by 82 million US dollars over the same period last year. And until the PGIA can reopen, it is only going to get worse."
"Now even as we pushed to reopen, we had to bear certain facts well in mind. With regard to international travel prohibitions, the US decision to ban Chinese visitors from as early as January of this year was widely applauded. At its peak though, only 82,000 of 1.3 billion Chinese were infected and Chinese visitors to the US represented just about 3% of the US’s total annual visitors. Yet the US proceeded with its embargo on Chinese travel to America. Currently, the US also bans visitors from Brazil; 320,000 Brazilians are infected of a total population of 210 million, and Brazilians represent just 4% of visitor flows to the US."
"In our own case vis-á-vis the US, we had to reflect on the fact that there are 1.8 million Americans infected, a third of all COVID-19 deaths are US, and that country is the source of 75% of our visitors. So, the US in circumstances of a relatively minuscule visitor flow from Brazil and China, nevertheless froze all travel from those two countries. The logic for our initial proscription ban on travel to Belize from the US in the context of their world leading infection rate and their being our 75% source market, is thus clearly irrefutable. That is why our drive to reopen PGIA had to be subject to our doing our absolute best to mitigate the undeniable and serious risk of imported infections coming from any resumed flow of US visitors."
"Accordingly, the decisions of the NOC and Cabinet regarding the PGIA were premised on our first putting in place a comprehensive set of protocols to govern reopening. The centerpiece of this was/is to be a testing requirement. Now it is a fact that reliable rapid tests, on which I personally had pinned a lot of hopes, are not currently available. Our only recourse was, thus, to go with the PCR tests that currently both we and the US use, and which are the WHO gold standard. What we decided was that US, and other visitors would be able to come to Belize via the PGIA, on one principal condition. They would need to present upon arrival a negative COVID-19 PCR test result; and they would need to have obtained that negative result no earlier than 72 hours before traveling."
"We checked via our Embassy in Washington and our Consulates in Miami, Los Angeles, New York, and Chicago, on the ease or otherwise of getting tests in the US in preparation for travel. It became clear that the processes differed widely from state to state and even among different counties in the same state. Still, the requirement for travelers to test remained a sine qua non for us as we sought to protect our Coronavirus-free record in the midst of any external reopening."
"We, therefore, informed, via the Belize Tourism Board, the airlines of this condition that would attach to travel from North America to Belize. They did not object and the information was that they would still be prepared to come. We, therefore, appeared all set to confirm this morning our July 1st PGIA reopening. Alas, what the poet said about the best laid plans of mice and men proved only too true on this occasion."
"Yesterday IATA, the International Air Transport Association, sent a message to our Director of Civil Aviation. That message made clear IATA’s disapproval of the Belize travel testing requirement. According to IATA, that could not work now, and Belize should wait on the development of a reliable rapid test that would allow for the airlines themselves to administer a pre-boarding test. After that the dominoes started falling. The carriers changed their tune, and it became clear that they would not fly to Belize if we insisted on travelers coming armed with a negative test result. I repeat, though, that our paramount safety concerns mandate our holding firm on that requirement."
"Long story short? I am in consequence of all this today unable to confirm July 1st as a firm reopening date for the PGIA. If IATA holds its position that is seemingly mirrored now by the airlines, we will not be able to reopen until there is mass availability of approved rapid tests. Now, of course, in the meantime, if there are chartered carriers that would want to come to Belize on condition that their passengers would in fact be able to present a negative test result upon arrival, we would reopen for that sort of a purpose. But generally, because of the position now taken by the airlines, there cannot be the hoped-for reopening of the PGIA on July one. Of course, there are already rapid tests on the market but not with the needed degree of specificity and sensitivity. Everything suggests, though, that rapid testing nirvana is imminent. And the moment that happens, we will be good to go. Having not been able to secure July 1st, you will understand that I don’t feel comfortable hazarding a guess, an estimate, as to the actual new date. We, therefore, take it one step at a time with the commitment continuously to update you as the situation unfolds."
I close with one assurance. GOB is working with the DFC on funding tourism sector loans at concessionary rates as a stopgap until the sector can return to strength.
"In other words, in this as in all other things we, this country, will come through. Given how well we have done in containing COVID-19, everyone surely knows that this note of hope is not at all misplaced but absolutely and completely justified."
Thank you and I am certainly now prepared to take your questions.
"My fellow Belizeans,"
"Last week, when I provided an update on Government’s crisis response to COVID-19, I offered a reassurance of broad financial sector stability and, in particular, of continued commercial access to a sufficiency of foreign currency supply for essential imports."
"The certitude I conveyed is sowed by a ceaseless, creative campaign to tap every available source of external financing in support of our economy."
"In the next few days, the first disbursement from the IDB’s package is expected; and thereafter, in rapid succession during the ensuing months, the flows will come from Taiwan, the World Bank and OFID, in a total amount of some US$100 million. These fresh inflows will augment the Central Bank’s official reserve position, which currently surpasses the traditional 3 months of import cover. And the renewal of tourism earnings will commence during the third or, at the latest, fourth quarter of this year."
"Over and above these three distinct layers of foreign exchange supply, I am pleased to announce now a groundbreaking initiative by the Central Bank: the first-ever public placement of a U.S. dollar-denominated Treasury Note, backed by the full faith and credit of the Government of Belize."
"With a face value of US$30 million, a tenor of 5 years and a coupon of 6.5%, the special offering will be launched on June 05, 2020. Interest on the Note is to be paid semi-annually and principal redemption will be settled in three equal tranches at the close of Years 3, 4 and 5."
"Proceeds of the Note are purposed to augment the stock of official Central Bank reserves while the maturity is tailor-made to span the crisis. Hence the affordable principal payoff dates, positioned well beyond what we believe to be the temporary economic slump caused by the COVID-19 lockdown."
"To facilitate the remittance of interest and principal payments, successful purchasers of these Notes, whether individual, institutional or corporate, will of course be eligible for domestic U.S. dollar accounts.  The Central Bank and our commercial banks will closely collaborate to ensure a subscription process that is both efficient and diligent."
"It is widely acknowledged that U.S. dollar accounts have been held abroad by Belizean businesses and individuals from time immemorial. This tax-free Treasury Note now has been crafted as an exceptional, seamless opportunity to relocate this capital to a safe, fixed income asset of the highest credit quality available in Belize."
"Beyond the innovation of this first-of-a-kind Treasury Note, Government and the Central Bank will continue to engage financial intermediaries and their customers, encouraging fair and timely measures that foster confidence, stimulate employment and protect equity."
"I reaffirm, in closing, my unshakeable confidence that we will bridge this crisis. When our country reopens for transnational business, the medical success that together we continue to achieve in containing the COVID-19 virus, will unquestionably elevate the prestige and the premium of our Belizean brand."
I thank you.


"Ladies and gentlemen, good day."
"Belize wishes to commend Jamaica and Canada for attempting this much-needed initiative to coordinate a global response to the catastrophic economic and financial impact of COVID-19. The actions we take now can help to ameliorate the impact of this catastrophe. But if we do nothing, or if our actions do not frontally address the economic consequences at their root, the economic and social impacts for people on the ground will continue to be tremendously negative."
"Suffering is manifold worldwide. For the first time since 1998 the World Bank projects that the global extreme poverty rate will increase, effectively eroding progress that has been made.  Far from being the great equalizer, COVID-19 is the magnifier of inequality. This is particularly hard felt in countries such as my own."
"Belize, a tourism dependent, export-oriented country, suffered an abrupt economic shock when travel and tourism ceased in March. At least 20,000 workers in tourism alone lost their jobs in one go at the height of the tourist season; and agriculture immediately felt the impact as well because that market for fresh produce immediately disappeared. Twenty thousand in one sector may not sound like a lot, but for a small economy with a relatively small population, unemployment doubled from 10% to at least 20%."
"The height of the pandemic in Belize coincided with the start of a predictably volatile Atlantic hurricane season. Over the past few years, Belize has been experiencing increasingly erratic extremes of drought and floods. Five days ago, Hurricane Nana bore down on southern Belize and severely damaged our export and domestic food crops, and damage assessment is currently underway.  Before this hurricane, the IMF and World Bank were predicting GDP contraction for Belize in the region of 20% to 25%. To that we now have to add the impact of hurricane."
"This is a reality that science predicts we are destined to suffer again and again. While we do not contribute to the changes that are increasing these climate events in both their regularity and intensity, we do carry the disproportionate burden of their impacts and consequential cost. SIDS are likely to experience GDP contraction in 2020 at three times the global rate as a result of the pandemic alone.  Factoring for climate impacts, that contraction becomes all the more unpredictable and dire."
"I challenge you all to step in our shoes, as uncomfortable as they are, and look at each of the policy options you have placed before us. Examine, when applied to SIDS, like Belize and the rest of the Caribbean in particular, that are facing the twinned crises of a pandemic and climate change, how these will expand our access to finance. Tell us how these will assist us to avoid being strangled by already high debt   which has to be compounding as we borrow to meet the added costs of meeting healthcare needs and minimal social safety nets for the unemployed and vulnerable populations. Demonstrate how these policy options will improve our capacity to stay on track to achieve our sustainable development goals and our ambitious climate targets by keeping our economies and our people alive."
"In our assessment, these policy options give us little hope at this stage.  Six months into the COVID-19 pandemic, our budgets literally have collapsed and there is no really predictable timeline for an economic rebound. Yet, the proposed policy options would have us, in the short-term carry an additional burden of even greater debt, or worse, enter into structural adjustment programs, when our economies have already been adjusted downward, our public sector revenues have collapsed while health related and social safety net expenditures have had to increase. In the medium-term we are directed to a variety of purported financial solutions, but these rely on goodwill and the financial backing of others who may well be too pressed themselves."
COVID-19 has exposed the inefficiencies of the global financial and economic systems in addressing global economic contraction and these options today suggest an unabashed affirmation of business as usual. They can be crudely narrowed to a choice of upholding markets at the expense of the public good.
"The options we set forth now will be definitive of our people’s future.  The options that will enable Belize and other SIDS to recover and do better, must include: access to liquidity for all SIDS on grant and concessional terms; debt workouts inclusive of private creditors; debt for development and debt for climate swaps; and recovery aligned with the Paris Agreement. To sidestep this imperative would be a disservice to all our future generations.  What we need more than anything is the action to support our words or small island developing States will be tip toeing under the feet of the Colossus to find ourselves dishonorable graves."
Thank you.


"I have been delivering Independence day speeches for over twenty years now, either as Leader of the Opposition or as Prime Minister. I do so one last time today in circumstances that are the most taxing in a generation."

"Of course, Governance is never a smooth continuum. The general caprices of human affairs are multiplied ten times over in matters of state. For our country, then, the poetic notion that we are ultimately bound for glory has always been accompanied by the prosaic everyday struggle actually to scale the heights; to regain our foothold when we slip; to clamber back up; to resume our climb towards what we see as the summit of our destiny."

"Every Independence Day’s stock taking, therefore, has acknowledged that success is not linear. Unfailingly, though, the ledger has confirmed more progress than problems; that our hard work and optimism and talent mark us in the end as sure to prevail."

"Now, however, we are confronted by a confidence-buckler of a pandemic, one that is as relentless as it is devastating. It appeared in the early days that we had it pretty much licked. Given this latest surge, however, we may be forgiven for thinking it somewhat like the American game of whack-a-mole. I remember the debate that raged about the reopening of the PGIA. Many of us feared that the return of the tourists would mean importing the virus, multiple cases of foreign infection. As it turned out, though, our problem proved not to be external. Like that old horror movie trope, the scary thing was not what was threatening to invade from without our tightly shuttered home. It was rather the danger from within: the jumpers and the contrabandistas, obstinately and repeatedly going across our supposedly sealed borders to places where the proliferation and danger were astounding. That was the principal source of the importation; and it was exacerbated by the heedless in-country behavior of too many: the partying with Dionysian abandon, the ignoring of the mask wearing and social distancing and public gathering rules."

"Notwithstanding all this, I am certain that we will defeat this covid-19. Even as I speak there is qualified good news. That is because the testing record over the last month or so, shows a trending week-over-week percentage deceleration of positive cases. The phenomenon of indiscipline, the lax or wilful behaviour that contributed to the new outbreaks, is, I think, receding. The rapid tests that will allow for ease of mass detection and contact tracing, are steadily becoming more reliable; and the vaccines that will provide immunity now appear within reach. Remember that at the virtual global meeting recently convened by the WHO, 30 Heads of State pledged, as a matter of the greatest urgency, an additional 37 billion dollars to accelerate development, production and equal access to Covid-19 tests, treatment and vaccines."

"All this is a huge plus to our own reset here at home. There is little doubt that our minds are now wonderfully concentrated in terms of the necessary behavioral changes, the enhanced surveillance to ensure that we better look out for ourselves and each other. Thus, I am firmly convinced that it is now just a matter of time till we come safely to shore."

"When that happens, when these trials and tribulations are in the rear view mirror, this generation will be remembered and celebrated as ultimately having thwarted one of the foulest periods of Belizean history."

"Of course, we will always lament that so many of our people have been afflicted. We will always grieve for those fallen to the plague. Likewise, we will not gloss over our shortcomings, our blank fear at the start as we struggled with a phenomenon that none could have imagined, for which none could have prepared. But we will ever know that during our greatest trial we once more found our heroes: our nurses and doctors and health inspectors and immigration and customs officers; our police and our soldiers and our coast guard and all those that defend the ramparts against this insiduous scourge. We fought and are fighting what is not even tactile, what seems spectral but is all too real. It is a virus no bigger than a mote of dust, something we can’t touch or feel or see. Still, it has felled us in numbers, rich and poor and high and low."

"It is an irony of ironies, though, that this merciless leveler is also a great elevator. In basic ways, it has validated our humanity and our Belizeanness. We have come together as one. We have lifted each other up. We have found new ways of doing things. We have called forth those great national reserves of resilience and courage. We are carried aloft by our front line workers, those  that sometimes clock 24 hour shifts. We are inspired by the hardscrabble creativity of everyday people: the tacos and tamales makers, the coconut huskers and juicers, those women and men that have gone from street side hawking to internet vending in order to preserve their livelihood and feed their families."

"In the end, the selflessness of the many is far outdoing the selfishness of the few. We have thus remained unconquered. No coronavirus storm, no Hurricane Nana, is able ultimately to defeat our core values, scar our Belizean culture or deface the spectacular physical and spiritual beauty of this our own, our native land."

"So, it has been, and is, a test for the ages. But as never before in our lifetimes, Belizeans have risen to the challenge. People and Government, politicians of all stripes, business and labour, social workers and NGOs, all are doing their share. No one can doubt that against this phantasmal enemy, we are deploying our united best."

"The role of the Administration in all this has been, perforce, an outsized one. The ravages of the pathogen have confounded even the most developed countries, the most advanced scientists the world over. More so for small countries, where flaws and gaps are magnified a thousand fold. I nevertheless put it to you today that in fighting this pandemic our authorities have done a creditable job despite the loss, so far, of more than a third of fiscal revenues. No doubt propelled by the example of so many brave and resourceful citizens, GOB has striven mightily to do its duty; in particular to discharge its core function of attempting to assist all, especially the so-called least of our brethren. We have been able to unlock funds, both locally and internationally that, while never enough, have been plentiful. Thus, it is that 39,129 households have received, and continue to receive, packages under our food assistance program. This has been at a cost of 20 million dollars; and with another 20 million coming from OFID, we are doubling the amount of beneficiary families."

"Our very important Unemployment Relief Program was implemented right at the start of the pandemic. We borrowed 75 million dollars from the Central Bank of Belize to do this, and spent 35 million to assist 40 thousand persons during the four-month period of phase 1 of the project. The number of persons assisted included both those that had lost their jobs because of the pandemic, and longer term unemployed."

"Phase 2 of the URP has now started and Government has made an even greater commitment. On the basis of funds left over from Phase 1 plus what has been secured from the IDB and what is to be had from CABEI, we will be able to assist another 50 thousand unemployed for an additional period that should last through December."

"We have, because we sorted out kinks and Phase 2 is moving far more rapidly than Phase 1, already made first payments to 20 thousand of the new applicants."

"We have also programmed 10 million dollars for loans, grants and subsidies to the MSME sector. This is money that (together with another 10 million used to start the food rollout) we took from the 75 million dollar CBB loan. It is, though, all being replenished with the new IFI flows."

"Agriculture, as one of our economic mainstays, is also featuring prominently in our assistance portfolio. 16 million dollars has been allocated for cash disbursements and resource financing to our farmers. These include particularly small and women farmers, and the payouts are already being processed."

"The current 3128 household recipients of subsidies from Government’s longstanding Conditional Cash Transfer program, also known as BOOST, are now getting increases in their stipends. Also, GOB has procured another 26 million dollars from the World Bank with which to start BOOST 2.0, more formally know as Belize Covid 19 Cash Transfer. This will add 10,500 more households to the program with the funding sufficient to cover them for an initial six-month period."

"Perhaps most important of all, 20 million dollars has been approved by the IDB for procuring additional health sector supplies, refurbishing facilities, taking on more personnel and paying the promised bonus to health workers."

"In the middle of all this, Government has also succeeded in making good, month after month, on the entirety of salaries for every single Public Officer."

"In most cases, as well, major capital projects have continued, preserving those jobs created in consequence of our hallmark infrastructure expansion."

All our schools are now reopening and Government is fronting 7 million dollars to purchase 15 thousand tablets to aid in the online learning for secondary level students. This is money that we will recoup from the IDB.

"Finally, the tourism sector is benefiting from a CDB/DFC 10 million dollar working capital line. The loans are at low interest rates partially subsidised by Government."

"This, then, is our proud record of comprehensive outreach and social protection during the pandemic."

"I thank all those international and bilateral partners, including Taiwan,  that have helped to make it possible; and I say that it is proof positive that Government acted with a comprehensive purpose from the outset to deal with the economic fallout from the crisis."

"This was, I also repeat, matched by our efforts to protect health and safeguard lives. We preemptively discontinued cruise ship arrivals even before closing the PGIA. We directed a national lockdown in the initial stage and we have subsequently isolated, as necessary, cluster-affected communities. We have tested aggressively; and we have legislated comprehensively the required behavioural safety infrastructure and surveillance. At every juncture Government has consulted broadly. We formed the National Oversight Committee right at the start, and have always sought the best available local and international scientific advice to guide our decision making."

"Naturally, the story is not yet ended, the saga not yet over. No one need doubt, though, that we will overcome. We declare this as a certainty, and our assurance is real. This is because it is based not just on stirring rhetoric or a Belizean call to arms. Neither is it based on platitudes. Rather, it is rooted in how far we have already come, and in the recognition of the need for the serious, sustained, programmatic action that will bring the necessary further success. That required action is local and global. It will demand comprehensive debt relief-bilateral, multilateral and commercial; and It will necessitate massive financial support from the IFIs, especially the Bretton Woods twins. Such assistance cannot be tied to normal-times conditionalities that are punitive and will hamper, rather than empower, recovery."

"Fortunately, those that control the levers of international power and the global economy, seem to get it. Already in the citadels of planetary decision making, the calls are growing for a post-pandemic order that will pay special attention to equitability and the needs of countries such as ours."

There is a recognition of worldwide interdependence notwithstanding the asymmetries of size. There is an acceptance of the imperative for differentiated treatment of small states. There is the embedding of the humanizing element needed to curb the inequalities of the old regime.

"In the end, though, Belize’s ultimate triumph will depend most on Belize itself. Our recovery, our tourism and agriculture and manufacturing and services rebound, will oblige us to work harder than ever, make more sacrifices than ever. Most particularly, we will now be mandated to deploy in fullest measure those innate talents, that Belizean capacity, which we proudly possess in demonstrated plenty."

"So, for me, I leave with the certain knowledge that we can do it; that we will prevail because our leaders- political and spiritual and social- are all united in their love for Belize, their will to rescue our country."

"Whoever comes next, then, will surely operate on the basis that it is vision, dedication and faith in Divine Providence that will bring us to safe harbour."

"And so, Hail and farewell. I thank all for the unmatchable privilege of having been allowed to serve this country; and God bless Belize!"

"Que viva nuestra Independencia, y que Dios nos bendiga."
"As the newly assigned Minister of the Blue Economy, I have been following with interest the recent developments regarding the proposed Port of Belize Cruise and Cargo Expansion Project. I have had the opportunity to be updated by our Fisheries Department as well as other concerned environmental non-governmental organizations that are all important players in the development of the new Blue Economy model.  We have been listening to the concerns of those that have been studying and opposing this project ever since it was proposed under the previous government as well as the consultants for the Port of Belize Cruise Project. I have also had the opportunity to dialogue with the Prime Minister and other ministers on this matter."
"After only two weeks of being installed as a government, the overall consensus is that there are so many other pressing issues of national importance that need our urgent attention such as the economic crisis our country is presently in; the increasing number of COVID-19 cases and deaths; and the effects of major flooding in many parts of our country. These are the issues that are priority for us."
"This is a new government, a government that has envisioned and brought to reality a Ministry of Blue Economy which will ensure equilibrium between economic growth while protecting and conserving our oceanic ecosystem.    We must emphatically state that this proposed project has not been endorsed by the Ministry of Blue Economy."
"From our discussions with other key entities including our own Fisheries Department and other environmental groups, we gather that the consultation process has been flawed. There are several entities that have been called out as having endorsed this project while they have publicly stated that they have not. They may have been consulted but that cannot be classified as an endorsement.  With that said, the developers of the Port of Belize Cruise and Cargo Expansion Project are advised to re-think their consultation process and seek ways of addressing major concerns such as ocean dumping in the area proposed which has the potential to jeopardize Belize’s important World Heritage Site, the Barrier Reef, while significantly impacting the tourism sector. These are the important discussions that must be tabled under the watchful eye of the new Blue Economy Ministry."
"Our Ministry has swiftly embarked on the process of formulating a Blue Economy Master Plan. Under this process, proposed projects such as the Port of Belize Cruise will be given greater attention and consideration.  Recognizing that sustainable development is needed to catapult the economic recovery of our country, our mandate calls for greater reliance on the scientific community while assuring economic, social and environmental security for Belize."


Statement on Pro-Good Governance and Anti-Corruption
Hon. John Briceño
Prime Minister


"Today, as across the world countries and governments celebrate Anti-Corruption Day, I take this opportunity to reiterate my unwavering commitment, and that of my government, to fight corruption wherever it is found, in government or out."

"My People’s United Party was elected on November 11th with the most overwhelming mandate in Belize’s political history. It was a victory for the people of Belize, and a message to the outgoing administration that corruption would no longer be tolerated. Indeed, brazen, sickening corruption had become the order of the day, and over the past decade had infiltrated every government Ministry and Department."

"We have made a covenant with the people that no longer will corruption be tolerated as an inherent part of politics. Already we have put structures in place where before there was none. We have commenced investigations in Ministries where public monies and public trust were raped and ravaged. The preliminary findings are shocking, worse than even we could have anticipated, and those will be made available to Belizeans very soon."

"We have directed forensic audits of all statutory boards and utilities, with a view to identifying corruption, restoring oversight and checks and balances, recovering the people’s assets which were stolen and misappropriated and in bringing those guilty to justice. We will ensure that all relevant agencies are empowered to provide necessary oversight and prosecution powers."

"As a responsible, serious government, we will restore good governance, integrity, transparency and accountability to office. We will lead through service to our people and to our nation."




Statement to the Nation
Prime Minister Hon. John Briceño
"Belmopan. April 7, 2021."

"My fellow Belizeans,"

"Beginning in early February, the Government embarked on widespread consultations as an integral part of the preparation of the budget for fiscal year 2021 2022."

This is consistent with my Government’s commitment to consult stakeholders on major issues affecting the welfare of our people and nation.

"These consultations have taken place against the backdrop of the dismal state of the economy and public finances. Many of you will have experienced dramatic slowdown in business activity, job losses, pay cuts, and business closures. The fact is that the economy contracted by 14 percent and 64,000 Belizeans lost their jobs in 2020-21. It is imperative and urgent that we re-energize the economy and create thousands of jobs."

"On the issue of Government finances, the story is just as dismal. In fact, it is worse. Government collected far less in 2020-2021 than was projected."

"Total recurrent revenues and grants are projected to fall by 28 percent; GST collections fell by 32 percent. On the expenditure side, total spending fell by only 15 percent, far below the 28 percent drop in revenue. There is a huge gap between revenues and expenditure. The primary deficit is approximately $300 million dollars. In effect, we do not have enough money to pay salaries, rent and the light bills. Like the economy, the need to return public finances to a sustainable path cannot be overstated."

"On Friday, the House of Representatives will meet, and I will read the Government’s budget for fiscal year 2021-2022. I will detail my Government’s carefully crafted plan to lift the economy from its near moribund state and explain the measures we propose to implement in order to end the contemptible, obscene and reckless UDP spending of the people’s money."

"But before Friday’s speech, we felt that it was important to update you on where we are with the Unions."

"I would describe the consultations as full, frank, and courteous. I thank all those who have participated in the consultations. In light of the dire financial position of the Government, we took a close look at every aspect of Government’s revenue and expenditure with a view to righting the ship of state. To do this, we must increase revenue and cut expenditures."

"We will propose a 31 percent cut in expenditure on goods and services by the Government compared to the last Budget. This is expected to reduce expenditure by $77 million. We will also propose a 10 percent cut in the expenditure on Subsidies and Transfers compared to the last Budget. This will reduce expenditure by $19 million. Additionally, we expect to negotiate substantial savings upwards of $50 million dollars on the Superbond to reduce Government’s debt-service outlay."

"In the context of these reductions, it is wrong to regard our consultations with the Unions as only about a wage adjustment. The consultations covered a lot more. It is important to explain why the discussions were wide-ranging, and to explain the context in which they were held."

Let me frame the challenge.

"Government is the biggest employer in Belize. There are 15,000 public officers including 4,000 plus employed in the education system and 4,900 in the security and border services."

"In 2008 when the PUP left office, the wages and pensions bill was $262 million dollars. In 12 years under the UDP the wages and pensions bill skyrocketed to $677 million dollars, an increase of 177 percent or an increase of $415 million dollars."

"I repeat, the Government has been borrowing about a million dollars per day to pay salaries, pensions, and expenses for goods and services. Last month, we were again forced to borrow $30 million dollars to meet expenses."

"Earlier today, the Financial Secretary informed me that the Central Bank confirmed that after mid-April salaries are paid, the Government will have insufficient monies and will be forced to borrow again to meet its obligations at the end of April."

The position is critical; public finances are on life support!

"The raw and unpolished truth is that we inherited a broke and plundered treasury from the UDP. After careful analysis and consultation, we remain convinced that a salary adjustment of $60 million dollars is absolutely necessary. Additionally, we propose to continue the increment freeze, which will account for another $20 million dollars annually."

"Unfortunately, the Unions have not, so far, agreed with us that these adjustments are needed. It is important for all of us, union members included, to know that the Government has provided the Unions with all information that they have requested. If they complained that information has been kept from them it is not so. Indeed, our consultations have been open and transparent."

"Additionally, we put forward numerous proposals in our attempt to win support of the Unions. For example:"

1. We proposed that public sector workers and teachers would work (4) hours less per week; they in return asked for 5 hours and we agreed.
2. We secured the agreement of the Central Bank to extend leniency on defaulting loans until the end of 2021;
3. Both the DFC and the National Bank have agreed to make available five million dollars in loans to public officers and teachers;
4. We have agreed to waive stamp duty on mortgage transfers by teachers and public officers;
5. We offered to protect the lowest income earners from core wage adjustment;
"6. We proposed reducing further the salaries and benefits for Ministers and Ministers of State, Representatives and CEOs;"
7. We agreed to accelerate the Reform Agenda including the Whistleblowers’ and Unjust Enrichment Laws; and
8. We supported the Joint GOB/Social Partner Monitoring Committee to assess the performance of the Budget every 6 months.

"In short, Government made every reasonable concession to garner support from the Unions."

"My fellow Belizeans, my Government was elected to office with a massive mandate to bring change. We were elected to fix the economic and social problems created by the UDP administration. The people of Belize have voted overwhelmingly against business as usual. Therefore, we intend to deliver on that mandate."

"After assuming office, I reported on more than one occasion that the UDP had bankrupted the country and that we would have to experience a period of austerity, before we return to economic dynamism and growth."
"Some people said, because of the austerity measures we had implemented, we would lose the municipal elections."

They were wrong.

The PUP received a historic mandate as the Belizean people in every district reaffirmed their faith and confidence in our party and in Plan Belize.

"Today I was informed that the Joint Unions are preparing for industrial action. That is their right.  As it is our responsibility to ensure that we continue to provide the needed services to our people, and we shall do so."

"To defeat COVID-19, fight poverty, grow the economy, create jobs, provide low-cost housing, and provide affordable education, we must first accept the reality of our financial predicament, and implement a plan that will deliver us from this difficult place where we are. I will explain our plan on Friday in the House of Representatives."

"My Government remains open to constructive suggestions that are consistent with the urgent need to reduce expenditure and to increase revenue. We cannot continue with the reckless borrowing for it will destroy us all. If we unite and support a plan to restore our Belizean jewel to economic prosperity, we will all win."

Como un gobierno … con un mandato sin precedentes…y elegidos para gobernar…tenemos la responsabilidad de gobernar para todos los beliceños. Tenemos la obligación de velar por el bienestar de nuestro pueblo en general.
Y es por esto… que hoy después de hacer todo lo posible para que los sindicatos entiendan y trabajen con nosotros para reponer la economía del país…hemos tomado la decisión de proseguir con el presupuesto que se les pre/sen/to.

Todo esto después que hemos hecho todo para satisfacerlos y justificar las decisiones.

Ha llegado la hora de seguir adelante y enfocarnos en sacar a nuestra gente de esta obscuridad.
"Nuestro plan es bueno…no fácil…pero equilibrado… y esta diseñado para forjar una sociedad trabajadora, productiva y viviendo una vida saludable y digna."
Pero para que logremos este objetivo necesitamos a todo beliceño.

¡De esto debemos salir juntos!

Thank you and may God bless Belize.


BUDGET SPEECH FOR FISCAL YEAR 2021/2022
Hon. John Briceno
"Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, Economic Development and Investment"
"Belmopan, Belize"
"Friday, April 9, 2021"
Introduction
"Madam Speaker,"
"I rise to present Government’s Estimates of Revenues and Expenditure for the Fiscal Year 2021/2022, and to report on the performance of the National Budget for the current Fiscal Year 2020/2021."
"This is the first budget for the 5-year cycle 2021-2025, the first also for my Administration — coming to office, as we did, on the thrust of a ‘wave election’ on 11th November 2020."
"That extraordinary mandate was ratified by an almost unmatchable margin less than four months later, in the municipal elections of March 3 of this year. With just 31 additional votes in the mayoral race and 23 votes in the elections for counsellor in the twin towns of San Ignacio/Santa Elena, our Party would have secured 67 of the 67 seats available instead of 65."
"Along with these historic endorsements have come immense responsibilities, which obligate us to rise to the demands of the Constitution, our Manifesto, and the national interest. And it is to that national interest that this revenue-collection and spending process -  the Budget process — must do justice."
That this Budget Presentation comes at a juncture of unparalleled national crisis is indisputable.
"Belize is facing her most severe economic, fiscal and debt crisis."
"And though the health crisis caused by Covid-19 is currently in remission, with the virus’s spread largely controlled, the recent ‘resurgence’ that is being seen in Europe, and closer to home, in Antigua and Barbuda, and elsewhere, should caution us that our substantial progress can quickly be reversed. To state the obvious, Madam Speaker, the virus is ever present, the risk to Belize and Belizeans remains real. We must remain vigilant."
"How we navigate through this extraordinary crisis; the extent to which discipline, sacrifice and solidarity prevail; the efficacy of our home-crafted Medium Term Economic & Fiscal Recovery Plan, will, in sum, determine the well-being of our people, the resiliency of the public finances and the durability of the value of the Belizean dollar."
"It is worth noting that the amount required to meet the demands of our constituencies typically outpaces budget funding even in normal times. The mismanagement and mess we inherited, however, has widened the gap between these two amounts to an almost unmanageable degree."
"At the outset, allow me to recognize the many contributors to this delicate, consensus-building budget process, starting, naturally, with my Cabinet and Parliamentary colleagues who have confronted this unprecedented national emergency with poise and with patience."
"And I thank also the social partners, with whom there have been genuine consultations. I acknowledge the Belize Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Belize Business Bureau, the Council of Churches and the NGO community. I applaud the Joint Unions for their extensive contributions as well as those many public officers whose execution of their duties had an impact in ways small and large upon the participatory exercise of composing this budget."
"When all is said and done, the National Budget is really a Budget about all the people — working people and businesspeople -  because from its birth to its burial, the National Budget touches all Belizeans in some way or the other.  And this budget in its plain speak, realistic goals and honesty will usher in a new time in our national development and with an optimism that the shared sacrifices we make today, will result in all of us being able to triumph tomorrow."

REGIONAL AND DOMESTIC CONTEXT
"Except for the opportunity to vote out the UDP Government, 2020 is a year most Belizeans would rather forget. What was designated in the Chinese calendar as the Year of the Rat turned out to be the Year of the Black Swan, with the onset of an unforeseeable, once-in-a-century global health disaster."
"From this rolling public-health-cum-economic catastrophe, there would be no safe harbor."
"* According to the IMF, the global economy shrank by 3.5 percent."
* Central America’s fell by 6 percent.
* The tourism-dependent Caribbean economies sank by 10 percent.
"The output generated by Belize’s economy, 40 percent of which was previously lifted by tourism’s propulsion, nosedived by 14 percent, a steeper fall than all except for 5 countries, 2 of which are fellow Caribbean, tourism-dependent states."
"With an economy already firmly in recession, having contracted all of 2019, the pandemic quickly turned the UDP recession into a full-blown depression. In addition to the thousands unable to find work before Covid-19, 64,000 more Belizeans lost jobs, thousands of businesses pivoted to emergency mode after a mandatory lockdown, and the Government, hamstrung from years of excessive borrowing, mismanagement and distracted by a pre-election feeding frenzy, could do very little, except, of course, to borrow, borrow and borrow more. By none other than Mr. Barrow himself."
"I digress, for just a moment, to lament the loss of life caused by the Covid-19 virus — 318 Belizeans to date, a loss far more regrettable than the loss of livelihoods. We continue to mourn these fallen Belizeans who succumbed to Covid-19 and offer prayers for the comfort of their families and loved ones. On this side of the House, we grieve for our colleague and friend from Corozal Bay, the late David Vega, who left us far too early."
"To the new Representative from Corozal Bay, the Hon. Elvia Vega-Samos, Dido Vega’s sister, we offer first our solidarity and of course our congratulations and full support."
"Madam Speaker it is undeniable that the UDP Administration turned over to my Government an economy that was far worse than a mess, they turned over an economy that was in veritable tatters: a busted budget for this fiscal year that has required average borrowing of more than $1 million per day, a soaring level of unemployment that is afflicting 29 percent of the workforce and a total public debt that’s the sixth highest in the world."
NOT even those on this side of the House could have imagined these possibilities.
"The sixth most indebted nation, the fifth most severe depression of 2020, our status as one of only 13 countries on the planet that do not even appear in Transparency International’s Corruption Index, hence leaving us without a ranking   that is the legacy of the UDP."
"This is the extent of the national decline which my Administration begins to reverse with this, our first National Budget proposal."

DOMESTIC ECONOMY AND FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS
"As a prelude to revealing Government’s overall Medium Term Recovery Plan, it is important to share some snapshots of the domestic economy as well as the financial sector. While the overall economic output fell by 14 percent, this drop was not uniform. Clearly, the service sector was hardest hit, with hotels and restaurants crashing by 60 percent and the yields in the overall tertiary sector dipping by 17 percent."
"Consequent to that fall, output in the secondary sector, where manufacturing and construction are recorded, fell, but not nearly as precipitously, with a decline of 1.8 percent. Sales of such products as flour and beer, which are tied to tourism, faltered, but hydroelectricity rebounded handsomely, rising by 15 percent, year on year for 2020."
"The primary sector’s outturn decreased by 2.4 percent, impacted largely by a 27 percent fall in fishing activities. Positively, agricultural output posted a positive performance, if just slightly, with a 0.5 percent increase, due largely to a rise in the revenue we earned from the sales of our southern staples, citrus and banana."
"Some crisis markers, at least temporarily, moved in unexpected directions — for example, the balance of trade, balance of payments and reserve position of the Central Bank. Imports fell for the year 24.5 percent, outpacing the fall in exports, and with remittances rising and profit repatriation falling, the balance of payment deficit narrowed from 9.3 percent of GDP to 6.9 percent. Government access to and rapid drawdown of borrowed funds expanded the import cover of the reserve position modestly, from 4.1 months in 2019 to 5.2 months in 2020."
"Relatively speaking, the domestic financial system maintained its solid standing. Excess statutory liquidity totaled $420.3 million at the end of last year, non-performing loans totaled 5.8 percent, and the weighted average lending rate stabilized at 8.5 percent."
"In its recent Article IV Statement, the IMF concluded that “the banking system entered the pandemic with abundant liquidity and strong capital buffers,” a rare positive assessment in an otherwise dire report by the Fund."
"A commitment to retaining strong fundamentals has not deterred the Central Bank from cushioning vulnerable borrowers; in fact, the Regulator has recently extended the forbearance framework that allows commercial banks to extend flexible repayment terms for customers. Last April, the Central Bank had also lowered the statutory liquid asset and cash reserve requirements, and adjusted select provisioning protocols, all with the goal of softening the edges of the crisis for bank customers."
"As a recovery picks up steam, the levels of asset quality, of non-performing loans and of bank capital will be closely supervised by the Regulator."

FISCAL YEAR 2020/2021 PERFORMANCE
Summary Estimates for 2020//2021
"Madam Speaker,"
"The projected outturn for the fiscal year ending 31st March 2021 is dismal, despite our back-breaking efforts since assuming office to halt the flow, the red ink — no pun intended — by limiting spending to priority areas and eliminating waste."
Revenue Performance in 2020/2021
"Total recurrent revenues and grants are projected to fall by 28 percent, exactly twice the level of the overall economic contraction for 2020. I repeat, for emphasis: for every dollar Government expected to collect, it actually collected 72 cents."
"And thus, friends, the actual amount that will be going into the nation’s pocket is likely to be, not the $1.239 billion that we expected to collect, but a considerably lower $899.6 million. Tax revenue derived from the major sub-categories of income, profits, property and international trade and transactions, declined at a rate that, for the most part, mirrored this average drop of 28 percent — the exception being the GST, which fell by 32 percent. Under the category of non-tax revenue, the fees collected for licenses fell by 52 percent while the capital revenue report projects the sale of crown lands to substantially exceed the budgeted amount."
Expenditure Performance in 2020/2021
"On the expenditure side, total spending fell by only 15 percent, far below the 28 percent drop in revenue. This is the crux of the exigency we face, and it cannot be over-emphasized. The amount we have been collecting fell by a significant amount — almost a third of what we used to collect. But we’ve only advanced halfway in our efforts to reduce our spending to match the huge drop in what we earn. In other words, we’ve only moved halfway toward the point where we need to be, even before factoring in debt service and principal repayment.  That’s the point where every dollar we spend is what we actually have   a balanced budget."
"The halfway point we are trying to bridge is a precarious position, fraught with risk. In a figurative sense, our financial face mask, in these Covid times, is halfway between our nose and our chin. It’s a dangerous level of risk exposure that must be addressed."
"The sectors in which total spending fell to levels lower than the amount budgeted included Goods and Services, with the amount spent on these two being clipped by 31 percent; Pensions, which fell by 14 percent, Subsidies and Transfers, which were reduced by 31 percent, and debt service payments, which were reduced by 54 percent. This decrease in debt service spending, the most substantial reduction, reflects the capitalization of the Superbond coupon payments which was agreed to by bond holders in August of 2020."
"Notably, amidst the cuts and reductions in spending in various sectors, wages to public workers actually rose by $11 million, or 2.5 percent."
"Overall capital spending exceeded budgeted levels by 5 percent, rising to $294.8 million from a budgeted level of $281.7 million."
"In summary, overall, for every dollar Government expected to spend, it actually spent 86 cents."
Outturn for 2020/2021
"The primary deficit and overall budget deficit are expected to be -8.51 percent of GDP and -10.21 percent of GDP, respectively, substantially exceeding the budgeted levels of -0.89 percent and -4.58 percent, respectively."
"In dollar terms, the last Administration sought approval to borrow $253.7 million for this budget but would actually have borrowed by fiscal year’s end, some $370 million. As a result of the capitalization of the super bond interest payment, that $370 million is a figure that is $53 million less than the amount of borrowing that would have been otherwise required. In other words, even without the super bond payment, the last UDP Budget borrowed 46 percent more than was authorized by Parliament last March."
"For every dollar of UDP spending in the final year of that administration, a monstrous 31 cents was borrowed. And for every dollar spent under this budget, 54 cents (more than half) will have been directed to wages and pensions; 25 cents on capital projects and 15 cents on payment for goods and services."
"Rather than curtailing borrowing as the debt levels rose, the last administration, I emphasize, ramped up the borrowing to levels that are simply beyond belief: in the FY 2018/19, budget borrowing represented 10 cents of every dollar of recurrent revenue; then in FY 2019/20, that figure more than doubled, with 24 cents of each collected dollar being borrowed. And this year just ended, 43 cents of each dollar of our country’s revenue was borrowed."
"Can there be any doubt that the deluge of UDP debt was deliberate, pre-meditated and designed in equal parts to disguise the underlying decay to the public finances, to fund a pre-election orgy of hustling, and to sabotage their successor?"
"Their disgraced brand of costume party politics, the short-sighted lack of concern for the next generation, has pushed all of us to the very edge of default, the erosion of our exchange rate and national disgrace."

PUBLIC DEBT
"For purposes of full disclosure and for the record, let me elaborate on this most important subject of public debt. For the last 13 years during three UDP administrations, our country has been hurtling toward a debt crisis, heedless to the grave perils of over-borrowing, impervious to the generational poverty trap that unsustainable public debt lays for our people. Except for the Opposition, very few sounded the alarm, even as the then Government was obviously borrowing to fund regular wages, wage increases and increments."
"The scale of just how much the Government owes today is breath-taking: the equivalent of $10,000 for every man, woman and child; $50,000 in debt for each family of five; the inconceivable total sum of $4.2 billion -  that’s the number 4 followed by nine digits."
"For the average Belizean citizen, whose annual income under the UDP withered to $5,800, a level not seen since 1992, such unearthly indebtedness is unconscionable."
"For the nation state of Belize, this magnitude of public debt, some 130 percent of the country’s entire annual economic output, places us, as I indicated earlier, as the sixth most indebted country in the world. Of all countries, only Japan, Greece, Venezuela, The Sudan and Lebanon have a higher public debt ratio than Belize."
"Like a member of a family who returns home to discover that his or her sibling who was in charge of handling the family finances has not only squandered the savings but owes every bank and loan shark in town, my Administration took office inheriting a public debt position that has us teetering on the brink of sovereign delinquency, our assets mortgaged or sold, our precious currency peg perilously at risk."
"As it now towers over us, here is a breakdown of the public debt:"
"$872 million is owed to our bilateral lenders, 55 percent of which was borrowed under the Petro Caribe Program with Venezuela; while 34 percent of this amount is owed to the Republic of China on Taiwan and the small remainder to other friendly countries."
"$794 million is owed to multilateral lenders, with 36 percent owed each to the Inter-American Development Bank and the Caribbean Development Bank, 17 percent to OPEC, 7 percent to the World Bank and the balance to international financial institutions such as CABEI and the EIB."
"$1.168 billion is owed to external commercial creditors, 97 percent of which represents the so-called Superbond, while the remaining $60 million is a domestic US dollar bond issued by the Central Bank of Belize in 2020."
"And finally, some $1.35 billion is owed to domestic creditors, the largest portion, about $561 million or 41 percent, is owed to the Central Bank of Belize while domestic banks are owed some 28 percent of Government’s local debt stock."
"At present, therefore, two thirds of Belize’s public debt, approximately $2.8 billion, represents external loans that must be repaid with foreign currency."
The average interest rate on external debt is 4.2 percent and on domestic debt is 2.7 percent.
"Looking back, history will not be kind to those who maxed out the national credit card. It is no exaggeration to posit that the highest point in our country is no longer The Victoria Peak; rather, the highest point is now at the top of this debt mountain the UDP left for us to scale."
"Looking forward, this Government has assigned the highest priority to debt sustainability, with a goal of reducing the debt to GDP ratio to 85 percent by 2025 and to below 70 percent by 2030. To achieve this ambitious and necessary goal, my Administration is already taking the following steps:"
"First, a Debt Management Unit comprised of external and domestic advisors, with participation at the highest levels of the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Belize, has been mobilized. During the recent Article IV discussions with the IMF, the Unit outlined the debt management elements of Government’s Medium Term Recovery Plan, laying out its roadmap for achieving sustainability and for restoring prudence to the public debt, some of which I will now highlight."
"Second, negotiations to restructure the Superbond have commenced. In good faith, Belize invited the formation of a Creditor Committee on 19th March and proposed new terms for this obligation, which at US$556.5 million, represents 28 percent of outstanding overall debt and 40 percent of external debt. More importantly, the current interest payments, set at a coupon rate of 4.9375 percent, or $55 million annually, constitute 45 cents of every dollar budgeted for debt service in the Approved Budget for FY 2020/2021."
"In the proposed Budget for FY 2021/2022, there is a provision for the payment of a coupon consistent with the offer we have made to bondholders. That next coupon is due on 20th May 2021, by which time I would expect that negotiations would have been concluded. Last year, as Leader of the Opposition, I expressed the view that capitalizing this year’s interest payments, thereby increasing the amount of debt outstanding, was a self-defeating approach."
"To ‘extend and to pretend,’ as our predecessors did on three occasions during their debt negotiations in 2013 and 2017 and with last year’s capitalization, is, in our considered opinion, both unwise and unviable. This was also the unanimous verdict of a recent Debt Sustainability Analysis conducted by the IMF. Therefore, securing near-term cash flow relief, as well as overall principal reduction, is the unambiguous basis upon which the current negotiations must, in our view, climax."
"Third, an active review is ongoing with regard to other classes of public debt, with the exception of the already concessionary multilateral loans, so as to carve out for the country some short-term fiscal space, whether by means of write-offs, payment deferments, coupon reduction or discounted buyouts."
"And fourth, Government’s gross financing needs  - the amount of financing support required over the next 5 years within the construct of our Active Recovery Plan -  is projected to be about $1 billion. Diligent debt management will ensure this deficit funding is sourced on optimal terms. Already, with the support of our exceptional ally, the Republic of China on Taiwan, a new, 4-year Memorandum of Understanding has been formalized between our two countries, guaranteeing critical grant and loan budget support, commencing with a first payment of $80 million for this Fiscal Year."
"Now let me quote the words of the IMF in its recent Article IV Concluding Statement:  “The key policy imperative for Belize is to restore public debt sustainability and strengthen the currency peg.” This recommendation by the IMF could just as well have been taken from our Government’s home-crafted Recovery Plan. In the same fashion that Belizean families and businesses must be discerning in managing debt, borrowing only as a last resort and for the most urgent purposes, restricting themselves to loan amounts that can comfortably be paid back and to terms they can meet, and most crucially, leaving some room to borrow when the inevitable emergencies arise, so too must the Government approach its constitutional privilege to borrow in the name of its citizens."
"In short, Madam Speaker, public debt must be sustainable, and it must be managed for the public good."

THE RECOVERY PLAN
"Madam Speaker,"
"Before outlining the broad contours of the new Budget that I table today, I wish to outline the rationale and the framework for the wider Medium Term Recovery Plan."
"Erroneously, in some quarters it has been suggested, perhaps assumed, that the salary adjustment is the sole pillar upon which the fiscal recovery rests."
Nothing could be farther from the truth.
"The salary adjustment is necessary, but it is no fiscal elixir; that alone is far from sufficient to reverse the public finance morass left behind by the last UDP Administration."
"Painful as it surely is, the $60 million in salary adjustments and the $20 million foregone for increments and allowances in this Budget is one step in the hard slog back to fiscal fitness."
"A correlative to this cost curtailment step is the drastic reduction in this Budget of spending on goods and services, which is being slashed by $78 million compared to the previous budget."
"A second step is the reduction in interest payments which for this budget is being programmed at some $53 million less than what was allotted for the previous fiscal year. I have already addressed that subject of public debt management, in a substantial fashion, earlier in my presentation."
"The third step must be the augmentation of revenues. As Government and the Joint Unions have agreed, this can be achieved first by sparing no effort to collect current taxes from all sources from whom such taxes are due, and simultaneously, by ensuring that legitimate, outstanding taxes are recovered immediately."
"Whether current tariffs will suffice, without the need for incremental revenue measures, will depend on those who pay and those who collect. To those who evade the tax system, thereby imposing a disproportionate burden on the rest, I signal today, without hesitation, that the state’s enforcement agencies will hereafter adopt a muscular approach to revenue collection and enforcement."
"As a fourth and final step, Government and all stakeholders, especially the public service and the private sector, must together seed and reap higher, more equitable economic growth. Enabling investment, both domestic and foreign, is of the highest priority for this Administration, and I will outline later this morning some specific structural reforms we will adopt so as to foster the conditions for high growth."
"These four essentials form a carefully calibrated composite for our Recovery Plan: spending reductions, revenue enhancements, comprehensive debt restructuring and above-average economic expansion, all intertwined to underpin a renaissance of sturdy public finance."
"I am compelled to signal one other major imperative of our Recovery Plan, and that is the urgent need for public pension reform. Noncontributory pension payments in the budget have neared $100 million for a single year. That level of spending is simply untenable. When we left office in 2008, the annual cost of pensions was $38 million. Today that has virtually tripled. Government must move now to transform the public pension scheme to a contributory structure, either standing on its own with payments from both employer and beneficiary, or a merger of the public pension program and the Social Security System."
"To be completely clear, this Recovery Plan is not without its downside risks, some risks recognizable as being so grave as to imperil the Plan itself. If, for example, some variant of Covid-19 defies the vaccine campaign and tourism fails to gradually recover; or if hurricanes, floods or droughts return in the near term to extract another substantial economic toll, then all bets would be off and a more aggressive recovery program would be required."
"For this year, the IMF forecasts only a modest GDP rebound of 1.9 percent, with a steep upswing of 6.4 percent projected for 2022. Their prediction is that a return to pre-Covid economic activity will not occur until the FY 2024/2025 period. While we are more optimistic, contingency plans will be at the ready in the event that the rebound is protracted."
"I am confident, though, that if we all adhere to the Recovery Plan, if we achieve our revenue and spending targets, if we restructure and re-profile the public debt and if we can catalyze sustained economic expansion, together as a nation we would have averted default and the depreciation of our dollar. We would have protected thousands of public sector jobs and retained our fiscal sovereignty."
"In subsequent years, once an economic recovery takes firm root, once the debt is on a stable footing and primary surpluses are being achieved, then increments can be restored and targeted spending, particularly on the more ambitious goals of Plan Belize, can expand."
"As Prime Minister, I control the behavior of neither viruses nor the climate. What I propose, what we are elected to coordinate, is a credible, time-bound Recovery Plan."
"Renewal, reform and rebound are the lodestars of this Administration."

FISCAL YEAR 2021/2022: THE NEW BUDGET
Summary Estimates for 2021//2022
"Madam Speaker,"
Assembling any budget is always a high-wire balancing act.
There are limited funds and virtually unlimited calls for spending.
"Assembling a budget in the midst of a pandemic and economic depression is excessively rigorous if, as I insisted, we conform to these general requirements:"
"First, that the budget moves the economy decisively to a sustainable foundation, so that we can reduce the deficit, and thus lower the need for borrowing. These FY 2021/22 forecasts of revenues and expenditures are tethered to reality, not to political showmanship. And this is belt-tightening that is necessary, I reiterate, because of the UDP mess that we have inherited."
"Second, that the adjustments made in the movement towards a balanced budget are spread as evenly as possible and are shared equitably so that no one sector or group of people suffers disproportionate pain. Thus, it will be evident that reductions are being made to all recurrent spending lines — to wages, to goods and services, to transfers and subsidies and to debt servicing payments, in as tolerable proportions as possible."
"Third, that capital investments — both Capital 2 and Capital 3 outlays — be preserved, and, where feasible, augmented, since this category represents the only form of stimulus that Government can afford at this time. Public spending represents 39.2 percent of national output, making our capital investment program the single leading indirect provider of private sector jobs, in addition to the employment of those who are directly on the public payroll — a payroll that is also the single largest in the economy."
"And fourth, that priority be given to spending in the areas of health, poverty mitigation, education, citizen security, rural development and of course, the maintenance and development of the infrastructure of our National Logistics Network. Giving everyone a fair shot at prosperity, more so because of the inequities in society that the extant crisis has compounded, is our urgent duty. A recent regional study has illustrated that failing to do this, will “raise polarization, erode trust in government or [cause] social unrest.”"
"Upon this principled scaffolding, we proceeded to build the Budget for this Fiscal Year, which projects total revenues and grants of $1.030 billion, an increase of 14.5 percent compared to the projected outturn for FY20/21."

Estimates of Revenue and Grants 2021/2022
"Of recurrent tax revenues,"
"* $247.5 million will come from income and profits,"
"* $6.4 million from property,"
"* $137.7 million from international trade and transactions,"
* And $484.7 million from the goods & services
"Non-tax revenue will total $81 million, the two notable line items being Royalties, forecasted at $29.4 million, and levies collected by Ministries, forecasted to be $32.6 million."
Capital Revenues are projected to total $5.2 million.
"Grants will total $67.4 million, the principal contributors being the Republic of China on Taiwan at $20 million and the UK Government through the Caribbean Investment Fund at $22.5 million."
Estimates of Total Expenditure 2021/2022
"Overall expenditure will total $1.204 billion, of which recurrent spending represents $905.9 million and capital spending $298.6 million."
"Of recurrent spending,"
"* $413.7 million will be on Wages,"
"* $91.0 million on Pensions and Ex-Gratia Payments,"
"* $175.5 million on Goods and Services,"
* $68.4 million for debt serv
I wish to underline the fact that every category of spending will fall compared to last year’s budget.
"On the Capital spending side, total investment will be $298.6 million."
Outturn and Financing of the Budget in 2021//2022
"At the bottom line is our primary budget balance, which is simply the difference between what you earn and what you spend, before interest charges, and it is the key measure of sustainability. For this year, the Primary balance will be a negative 2.91 percent of GDP or $97.99 million, which is less than half of last year’s 8.51 percent deficit."
"The overall deficit is projected at 4.93 percent of the GDP or $166.43 million dollars, and when the $109.3 million in Amortization is added to this number, the level of financing required for this year is 8.4 percent of GDP or $275.6 million."
This financing will be sourced from the following:
* $186.2 million from our development partners on concessional terms; and
* $89.4 million from domestic sources.
Rebuilding Fiscal Operations in 2021//2022
"In this Budget, the salaries and pensions of public employees will constitute 64 cents of every dollar collected by Government, and the costs attendant to their work, such as utilities, fuel, travel, etcetera, account for another 18 cents of each dollar. That leaves just 18 cents of recurrent revenue, some $176 million, to make all our interest payments that are due on $4.2 billion of accumulated debt, to fund all capital investment programs and to settle principal repayments."
"Rebuilding the edifice of the public finances on solid rock, means that Government has to borrow less each year, starting now with a reduction of almost 2 percent of GDP in overall financing for this Budget."
"And this Administration will have an unwavering commitment to a balanced budget, at the primary level, for Fiscal Year 2022/2023 — with the further aim to lift that primary to about 2 percent the following year and by Fiscal Year 2025/2026 to carry forward a primary surplus of no less than 3 percent of GDP."
"I am confident that these ambitious targets are attainable, because we did it before: the last two PUP Budgets for Fiscal Year 2006/2007 and 2007/2008 featured primary surpluses of 3.85 percent and 3.25 percent, respectively."
We can do it again.
"Before elaborating on the impacts of the new budget, I must restate how critical the role of private enterprise will be to the overall prospects for recovery. Recognizing this, Government recently amended the Central Bank of Belize Act to allow for an earmarked line of liquidity to support business continuity and recovery.   I can now confirm that the Central Bank will shortly launch the Covid-19 Emergency Business Financing Program to provide low-cost liquidity to small, medium and large enterprises.  Funding will be laser-focused on businesses that address the economy’s two pressing priorities: employment and foreign exchange earnings.  The $50 million facility, innovatively designed to share underlying risk with participating financial institutions and funded through a special purpose vehicle that will allow individual and institutional investor participation, will extend liquidity to eligible enterprises at a cost of 5 percent, for 5 years, with supportive repayment moratoriums for both interest and principal.  Transparent and based on proper risk assessment, with a loan ceiling for each category of borrower, this program will complement the credit products of the domestic banks and credit unions, amplifying job and foreign currency creation. While we cannot foretell the Facility’s success, if the available funds are distributed evenly across all 3 categories of prospective borrowers, there is the potential to impact 200 businesses and thousands of workers."

IMPACTS OF THE NEW BUDGET
"Madam Speaker,"
"During the upcoming Debate, scheduled for April 22nd and 23rd, I am certain that my colleagues will unwrap the innards of the Budget, Ministry by Ministry."
"Without detracting from their thunder, I would wish to accentuate the benefits that this Budget projects:"
"This Budget will preserve employment for 15,000 public servants, 4,900 of whom contribute to domestic and border security, while another 3,500 serve our over 100,000 students throughout the education system and the other 6,600 are on duty across the multiple departments and agencies of the national Government."
"In a sense, these 15,000 public servants have 405,000 full-time customers, who are the other citizens of Belize, as well as many thousands of part-time customers — those who reside in invest in and visit Belize. Their work, paid for by all taxpayers through the appropriations in this Budget, vivifies the State, enabling the quality of life and many conveniences that all Belizeans share."
"This Administration has resisted retrenchment and protected the wages of those earning up to $12,000 per year. Thus, no one earning $250 a week or less will face a salary cut thereby ensuring that NO government employee well fall below the $5 an hour minimum wage."
"The proceeds of this budget will service our national debt, both interest and principal repayment — presuming that new terms will be agreed upon for the super bond."
"To address the principled priorities, I cited earlier as the bedrock of this Budget, here are just a few of the related capital spending considerations:"
"* $15 million for the continued battle against Covid-19, including testing, personal protective gear, critical care supplies and so forth;"
"* $10 million for 238,800 additional vaccines to be acquired on discounted terms through the COVAX facility. You see madam speaker we know that an effective vaccine policy is indeed goo economic policy."
* $3 million for the ongoing food assistance program;
* $60 million for the Coastal and Caracol Highways;
* $3.5 million for new housing programs and low-cost housing support; this in partial fulfillment of PlanBelize
* $3 million for improvements to sugar roads and other agricultural roads; so that our goods can go from farm to table.
* $18 million for the ongoing restoration of the Phillip Goldson Highway; because safety matters
"* $16.5 million, combined, for improving education quality and delivery and for Digi-Learn because we believe in our plan to develop an education nation."
"* $5 million for upgrading of streets and drains nationally, with special allocations for rural and village roads;"
* $12 million for climate vulnerability reduction initiatives;
* $17.5 million for ongoing restoration of the George Price Highway;
* $5.5 million for community-based projects executed by SIF and BNTF; to improve rural living
"* $6 million for various national security initiatives, as well as for road safety programs;"
* $7 million for improvement to the tax collection system so that tax evasion and underpayments can be substantially reduced;
* $4.0 million to extend the Solid Waste Management Network;
* $4.6 million for the new passport system;
"* And more than $100 million dollars in additional capital investments designed to foster growth and efficiency, to alleviate the conditions of poverty, and to advance what the eminent labor economist and author Richard Layard labels “life satisfaction.”"
All this is in keeping with our promise to build a Belize that works of everyone “Todos Ganamos”.
"The well-being of all citizens, which this Budget strives to engender, will, as Layard recently wrote, eventually become totally accepted as the standard way of evaluating social policies and budget priorities."
"Tackling this budget, it is important to note, was carried out in a straitjacket because of our predecessors’ proclivity to extravagance, which led them to choose pavements over people, and roads over relief. How else could the UDP justify committing the Government to half a billion dollars, $520 million, on contracts for just 5 roadways -  the Caracol, Sarteneja, and Coastal Roads and the George Price and Phillip Goldson Highways?"
"$520 million is the equivalent of 4 years of average capital spending, leaving us with little discretionary space for anything else. No space for low-income housing, or poverty relief, or their vaunted pantry, or skills training, or rural development, or stimulus, or anything else."
"While in Opposition, we warned that people cannot eat streets and roads."
Nor can half of a billion dollars on roads ease the pain of poverty or a pandemic.
"Yet we must remain committed to our progressive agenda, we must, even in these lean days, seek ways to fulfill even partially our commitments to plan Belize."
"In this short time in government, we have learnt that if we want to leave the crisis behind it is necessary to stop thinking of economic and social policies as two separate entities. We need not only to invest more in social protection and public goods and services, but also to involve the private sector and civil society, (that is businesses, civil society organizations and citizens) in this effort."
"Through the Social Investment Fund, this organization that invests especially in the rural areas of our country, we have and will continue to provide for one of the most vulnerable sectors of our population.  This year we will continue our investment through the Basic Needs Trust Fund (BNTF) and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) in potable water systems and health posts in several villages that are still lacking these basic human rights.  SIF, through the BNTF 10, will also continue to invest in schools for our children in the rural communities. More schools in several villages will be built, expanded, and retrofitted to ensure that we create a suitable environment to develop the educational opportunities for our children while building the foundation of a skilled labour force."

"Investment in projects that decrease our vulnerability to climate change will also continue to be a priority for this government. Through the International Financial Institutions (IFI’s), and especially through the Green Climate Fund (GCF) soft loans, and more so grants, are actively and aggressively pursued at the local and at the municipal and national levels to address the climate vulnerabilities of coastal communities and waterways for the most part. Also, the agriculture sector will be assisted with these grants and loan projects, already underway, with institutional strengthening and financial assistance to adapt to the climatic changes and shifting weather patterns."
"Through my office, we will continue to support, and bolster the effectiveness of two special programs. The National Aids Commission and Restore Belize that directly work with two very vulnerable and often overlooked sectors of our communities."
"The at-risk young men and girls, that daily populate our prison, is a sector of our community that needs special attention. Presently Restore Belize, through one of its programs “the I am Belize Scholarship program” presently has 43 of these special young minds attending various high schools in the Belize district. These young persons are assisted in obtaining a high school education by providing them with full-service attention program to their needs including mentoring and coaching by the Restore Belize staff and assisting with daily needs like transportation and even food costs. This we intend to emulate countrywide recognizing that this is needed in all communities of our country. We must do everything we can for our youth and assist them to become productive members of our society."
"Another program of Restore Belize is the Trauma Informed Practices in Schools (TIPS).  As it stands it presently only offers capacity development training to teachers in respective schools. The schools, Maud Williams, St. John’s Anglican, and Queen Street Baptist have done trainings in 2019 and 2020. The long-term vision of the programme is for it to be a catalyst for change in the way duty bearers see their role in engaging with children, youth, and the community. Duty bearers are teachers, parents, community leaders including the police. The programme will have several spin-offs that will be specialized to meet the needs of the communities. The long-term plan for this program is for it to also roll out to the various districts as presently its Belize City centered"

STRUCTURAL REFORM
"Madam Speaker,"
"Back in January of this year, in a report to Parliament, I recounted that recessionary storms buffeted the real economy of Belize well before the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. For four consecutive quarters prior to the fourth quarter of 2019, the economy shrank, and even without Covid-19, the striking fact is that our economy shrank during 3 of the last 5 UDP years."
"The domestic economy starts in 2021 where it ended 2012 — producing 3.3 billion dollars of value in gross activity. Per capita income, we repeat, is at 1992 levels, shamefully lagging behind almost every regional peer, including Guatemala, El Salvador, Jamaica, Barbados, Grenada and many others."
"Here is the evidence that the UDP, long before leaving office, simply gave up on business:"
"Belize currently has a rank of 135 out of 190 countries assessed by the World Bank for Ease of Doing Business, again, trailing almost every regional peer. When it comes to starting a business, the ranking drops to 167 of 190. Put another way, only 23 countries on Earth are LESS efficient at facilitating the startup of a business than Belize is."
This cannot be allowed to continue.
This is not who we are.
"Belizeans are far better than this rank, our natural and human resources manifestly superior to this shoddy station, a station of which the UDP, after 13 years in office, must take ownership."
"Our Administration, this Government, pledges, in collaboration with the social partners and the citizenry at large, to spearhead a dramatic transformation of the business environment."
Here is how this will be achieved:
"First, our public officers, from security personnel to teachers to service providers, have a personal stake in this transformation. Service standards across Ministries and Departments will determine, directly or indirectly, budgetary success, and that budgetary success will be shared throughout the economy, but also amongst Government’s 15,000-strong team. That is the spirit and the substance of the recent Joint Union consultations."
"Ministers, CEOs and Heads of Departments will be expected not only to lead the way, but also to set the example."
"Second, a cluster of legislative enhancements will be rolled out during this first year of our Reform Plan, specific to areas such as exchange control regulations, securities and capital markets and company and insolvency laws. Complementing this fresh framework will be an E-governance campaign to enable online access to 90 percent of government services by the end of our first term."
"We have also committed to our multilateral partners, that as soon as this emergency abates, the Government will adopt a Fiscal Responsibility Law, with explicit rules moored to public financial management reforms. This framework will address public debt limitations, budget performance targets, correction mechanisms and an inclusive, transparent Fiscal Oversight Council. The Ministry of Finance is also committed to adopting a multi-year budgeting approach, upgrading the Cash and Public Investment Management and instituting fiscal risk assessment."
"Third, to spark this exciting era of prosperity — the new jobs, the infusion of foreign direct investment, the unleashing of export potential -  Government must tear down the unnecessary roadblocks to doing business. We have to fast-track the approvals for strategic investments, accelerate real estate-related processes, relax constraints for small and medium size business to operate, pursue private/public partnerships where these can provide capital and know-how, and urgently build up the National Logistics Network."
"Many stubborn, structural barriers to growth and diversification must be removed. To remove those barriers, we will have to improve access to credit through the creation of a credit bureau and credit collateral registry; lower barriers to entry into, and exit from, the market; carry out overdue labour market reforms to allow flexible working hours so that businesses can adjust to fast-changing market conditions; and transform education and technical training to equip workers and entrepreneurs with skills that match tomorrow’s economy, rather than yesterday’s."
"Finally, the twin maladies of crime and corruption must not be allowed to fester, for they gnaw at the critical core of investor confidence, befouling the overall environment for doing business. Notwithstanding our harsh fiscal restrictions, Government has provided, and I pledge, will continue to provide, the resources for a more vigorous citizen and visitor security strategy, complemented always by a robust social safety net for the vulnerable population."
"In addition, I expect that this year, flesh will be put on the bones of The Whistle Blowers’ and The Civil and Criminal Unjust Enrichment Laws — both solemn undertakings agreed upon with the Joint Unions during the recent budget consultations and is in keeping with our manifesto commitment to nurturing the national principles and dignity to public life."


CONCLUSION
"Madan Speaker,"
"Unlike a hurricane, a visible menace allowing those in its path to prepare, then to quickly assess the evident damage and start the rebuilding, this national crisis is different."
"What we are addressing is 13 years of UDP-induced foundational rot and decline, capped by the Covid pandemic."
"This compromised structure, as full as it might be of underlying potential for greatness, is now being buffeted by a rolling calamity, hitting us in surges, each surge finding us weaker and more vulnerable."
Those before us had no concern for tomorrow.
"They left the public finances on life support, with barely a pulse."
"The UDP engaged in a splurge with the double windfalls of oil royalties and the Petro Caribe funds — together over $1 billion dollars, which, today could have put $6,000 into the pockets of every working man and woman, if Government could have handed out that money as a stimulus check."
"But the oil royalties and Petro Caribe did not quench their thirst:  during their 3 terms in office, they borrowed over $3 billion cumulatively —a billion per term — leaving us with this $4.2 billion monster debt howling for repayment."
"While in their hands, a generational windfall vanished and from our hands must now come recovery and renewal."
I am confident that our Recovery Plan can turn things around.
We can reverse this decline and restore our tranquil haven.
"To do so, all stakeholders have to stop watching one another in a never-ending stare-down and start watching where we want to be in 5 years. At that glorious point of recovery, a few years from now, if we do the right things, unemployment will be in the low single digits, wages will be buoyant and growing, the economy will be humming apace at 4 or 5 percent growth per year, exports will soar like never before, and our dollar will be strong again."
"Government’s budget will return to a sustained surplus and the public debt will have been halved, or more."
"Plan Belize, our north star, our road map for re-emergence, will bring jobs at livable wages, a renaissance in agro-productive output, the return of investor confidence, land and home ownership opportunities for the disadvantaged, and a return to equitable economic growth."
"But we will only get to that prosperous place with national unity, with joint purpose and with ceaseless striving."
"The Father of the Nation, the Rt. Hon. George Price, often exhorted us to wake up and work. He summoned us to an untiring defense of the national good. Now, more than ever, we must trail his shining example of unconquerable optimism; and share his vision of a society aroused and attuned to the national interest; of an empowered Belizean people, prosperous and striding stout-heartedly to that better day when we can live out our promise that everybody fi win.  We remain convinced that working together and with the guidance of our Creator, this is well within our reach."
Thank you.


"My fellow Belizeans, as you are aware since February Government has been in consultations with the Joint Unions."
"Today, I wish to provide the Nation with an update on these consultations and discussions."
"In February 2021, in pursuance of our commitment to good governance, my administration initiated a budget consultation process with social partners including the churches, non-governmental organizations, the business community and the unions, with a view to receive budgetary recommendations from each of the social partners."
"Given the state of public finances and the severe fiscal imbalance inherited from the past UDP administration, the Government indicated to all social partners, including but not limited to the unions, that substantial measures would have to be taken including:"
"One   reduction of goods and services expenditures by at least 15 percent,"
"Two   debt restructuring to achieve debt relief and bring down debt servicing obligations,"
"Three- prioritized capital spending, revenue enhancement measures and"
Four   a salary adjustment of approximately 60 million dollars along with the increment freeze of roughly 20 million dollars for up to three fiscal years.
"After conducting such consultations and after requisite consultations were duly had by the Minister of Public Service, the Minister, noting the dire state of public finances and the need for urgent fiscal rebalancing, informed that, among other things, he will be advising His Excellency the Governor General to fix the salaries and privileges of the employees or other persons or groups within the public service with a reduction of 10 percent for salaries equal or to over Twelve Thousand Dollars."
"The General Revenue Appropriations Act, 2021, which contained approved budget estimates that provided for salary adjustments among other adjustments, was thereafter duly enacted as of the 6th May 2021."
"Even as these consultations were ongoing, the Unions declared their intention to engage in Industrial Strike Action and have followed through on that declaration of intent."
"Despite our deep disappointment with this decision taken by the Unions, Cabinet instructed our Ministerial Consultation Team to continue to meet and dialogue with the Joint Unions in a good faith effort to arrive at a resolution that would serve the national interest."
These efforts have led us to where we are today.
"Today I signed and sent to the Joint Unions a Letter of Government’s Undertakings which sets out in clear and specific detail each and every action our Government is committed to taking along with our Social Partners, including the Unions, to advance our shared commitment to good governance and fiscal sustainability."
"Given the national importance of this matter, I will now share with you the details of these undertakings:"
First Good Governance Reform
"The Protected Disclosures/Whistleblowers Protection Bill, 2021"
"The Government fully endorses the need for whistleblowers’ legislation to protect from civil, criminal and disciplinary proceedings persons who report improper conduct such as commission of a criminal offence and conduct that shows gross mismanagement, impropriety or misconduct in the carrying out of any activity that involves the use of public funds."
"To that end, the Government has drafted the Protected Disclosures/Whistleblower Protection Bill, has delivered such draft to the Unions and the business community and undertakes to the public that upon receipt of comments from the Unions by no later than May 18, 2021, it shall cause to be tabled before the House of Representatives by the end of June 2021 with a view to enactment thereof by the end of July, 2021."
"The Civil Asset Recovery and Unexplained Wealth Bill, 2021"
"Recognizing the grossly negligent and corrupt behaviour of public officials in the past in the acquisition, management, handling and disposal of public assets, the Government fully supports the establishment of a law that provides for recovery of public assets wrongfully acquired or disposed of, including the provision for unexplained wealth orders against those persons whose total wealth exceeds the value of their wealth lawfully obtained."
"In that respect, consistent with the Unions’ request, the Government has drafted the Civil Asset Recovery and Unexplained Wealth Bill, and delivered the draft bill to the Unions and the business community."
"Upon receipt of comments from the Unions, which should be no later than the 8 of June 2021, it shall cause to be tabled before the House of Representatives.   We hope to have this bill enacted by the end of July of this year."
Campaign Finance Reform Bill
Government supports the Unions’ request for the enactment of a campaign finance law.
This is in line with this administration’s Plan Belize Manifesto to return principle and probity to public life.
The Government is now in receipt of draft campaign finance reform legislation from both the business community and the Unions and has tasked the Attorney General’s Ministry to review the draft legislation and to develop a draft Campaign Finance Reform Bill by the end of August 2021.
Audit of Petrocaribe Funds
Government shall conduct a comprehensive audit of the use of Petrocaribe funds by the past UDP-led administration.
Rationalization of Public Service
Government will complete on an expedited basis the ongoing rationalization of public service exercise.
Numerous measures were proposed to public officers and teachers directly affected by the salary adjustment and increment freeze.
Some of these that have not been accepted by the Unions include as follows:
Reduction of work week by 5 hours or more than ten percent  of the work week.
"The issuance of a land credit in favour of affected public officers and teachers equivalent to 50 percent of the salary adjustment, which credit may be exercisable on the acquisition of government land by the holder of the land credit."
"For affected public officers who already own land, the credit could have been used in settlement of outstanding land taxes owing by the affected public officer."
"The land credit though not assignable would have been applicable in favour of immediate family members, namely, spouses and children of the affected public officer."
"Let me say again, Government remains committed to ease the adverse effects of the salary adjustment and increment freeze on affected public officers and teachers."
We are prepared to undertake the following:
Performance Bonus Option
National Health Insurance for Public Officers
Discounted data packages for teachers
Cash flow relief on loan payments
Waiver of Stamp Duty on Assignment of Residential Mortgages
Special Facilities at DFC and National Bank of Belize
Reduction of Ministers’ Salaries and allowances and
Increments Remain Applicable to Pension Payments
"Performance Bonus — Government shall pay in the form of an annual bonus, after the close of each of the current and next 2 fiscal years, any amounts that exceed the relevant annual Primary Balance Target.  The Primary Balance Targets established in the Recovery Plan are as follows:"
"Year 1, FY 2021/22, Primary Balance Target is a deficit of 2.9% of GDP"
"Year 2, FY 2022/23, Primary Balance Target is a surplus of 1.99% of GDP"
"Year 3, FY 2023/24, Primary Balance Target is a surplus of 3.75% of GDP"
The Performance Bonus Option incentivizes all budget stakeholders to focus on the common and beneficial goal of achieving the critical Primary Balance Targets of Government’s Recovery Plan.
The features of the Performance Bonus Option are as follows:
"[1]         The Performance Bonus, which is the equivalent of any overperformance as compared to the Primary Balance Target, will be paid on a pro-rata basis to all affected teachers and public officers as a single payment."
"[2]         The maximum cumulative Performance Bonus payment will be BZ$60m per year, representing the estimated foregone salary and increments for a single budget period."
"[3]         Where the Primary Balance Target is not achieved, there will be no Performance Bonus payment."
"For example, IF in Year 1, the actual primary balance is a deficit of 1.9% of GDP (compared to a target of a deficit of 2.9% of GDP), therefore 1% of GDP above the target, and this 1% represents $35m, then $35m would be available for performance bonus payment distribution to all affected teachers and public officers."
"[4]         Bonus payments, where applicable, will be made within 90 days of the close of the budget year."
"National Health Insurance for Public Officers — By no later than fiscal year 2023/2024, Government will establish a contributory health insurance scheme for public officers that covers medical, dental and vision care along with an ancillary death benefit.  Government will contribute 80% of the insurance premiums while participating public officers will contribute 20%."
"Discounted Data Package for Teachers — Government, through the Ministry of Education, has reached agreement with BTL for BTL to provide a fifty percent (50%) discounted 25GB data package to teachers."
"Cash Flow Relief on Loan Payments — The Central Bank of Belize has issued guidance to the banks and credit unions to extend the forbearance period on residential mortgages including those held by affected public officers and teachers to the end of this year.  Continued efforts will be made to urge leniency by banks and credit unions on residential mortgages including waiver of penalty fees whether on refinancing, transfer of loans or otherwise."
Waiver of Stamp Duty on Assignment of Residential Mortgages — Cabinet has approved and a draft bill is being prepared to be tabled to the National Assembly for enactment of the waiver of stamp duties on the assignment of residential mortgages held by public officers and teachers.
Special Facilities at DFC and National Bank of Belize — Government will ensure that the Development Finance Corporation and the National Bank of Belize makes available special facilities of in or about $3mn to $5mn per institution for public officers and teachers for residential mortgages at preferred rates.
"Reduction of Ministers’ Salaries —Ministers, Ministers of State and area representatives will be subject to an increased total salary reduction of 15%.  Ministers, Ministers of State and CEOs will also surrender 50% of entertainment and telephone allowances.  It is understood that heads of department will continue to surrender their allowances as already agreed in fiscal year 2020/2021."
Increments Remain Applicable to Pension Payments — Pension benefits of directly affected public officers and teachers shall be computed on the basis of emoluments that would have been applicable if the increment freeze had not been implemented.
Other Government Initiatives include
Recovery of Outstanding Tax Arrears
"Noting substantial arears of business tax, general sales tax, income tax and land tax, the Government will establish an integrated Tax Recovery Unit under the Belize Tax Services Department that will be tasked with aggressive recovery of all lawfully due outstanding tax arrears.  A project steering committee has already been established with representatives from the Ministry of Finance, Belize Tax Services Department and the Ministry of Natural Resources with a view make such necessary amendments to the applicable laws to enable the establishment and effective functionality of such unit."
"In addition, technical assistance is being procured therefor and for the establishment of a Revenue Court to support revenue/tax collection and enforcement of applicable tax laws."
Social Partnership Committee
"Government will establish a social partnership advisory committee comprised of representatives of the Government, NTUCB, the Churches, the business community and the non-governmental organizations, with its first meeting to be held by October, 2021.  The purpose of the Committee will be to provide recommendations on revenue enhancement, cost savings, tax reform and consumer protection.  Subcommittees may be established for each of these particular areas of scope.  The Government will provide updates on the state of public finances to this Committee every six months, starting with the first update at the first meeting of the Committee in October of this year."
Tomorrow our Ministerial team will meet with the Joint Unions to get their response to these undertakings.
It is my sincere hope that our Union Leaders and their members will appreciate and understand that our Government has exhausted every option in an effort to responsibly address the very serious and important issues and concerns raised by them over these past months.
"This is our last, best effort."
"My Government respects our Public Officers and Teachers and truly desires a strong, productive working partnership with them."
We are 6 months into a 5-year term of office.
There is much work to be done on behalf of the Belizean people.
"Working together, we have an opportunity for meaningful change and reform."
Let us embrace that opportunity starting tomorrow.
Let us all get back to the important work of building this our Beloved Belize.
I thank you.

"Today, at 40 we celebrate as a nation."
We celebrate even amid this pandemic that has tested us and taken so much and so many from us.
Yet our love for this land and everyone who lives here has never been stronger and never more determined.
"COVID -19 has tested us, changed how we live, how we work and how we pray. It has tested our mettle by forcing drastic changes to our daily lives none more so than having to keep apart from each other."
It has kept our children away from school and their friends.
"It has kept loved ones from celebrating weddings, young parents from bringing their family together for christenings and even burying our dead, things we hold near and dear."
"Ten months ago, our party got elected to government with a resounding mandate."
"We immediately got to work delivering on our ambitious agenda, Plan Belize."
Plan Belize remains our north star.
"For this reason, from day one we have been working to make our communities and neighborhoods as safe and as healthy as we can."
Our first task has been and must be defeating COVID.
"We do this by making vaccines available for everyone, and we are doing that."
Today every Belizean from 12 and up can and should get vaccinated to protect ourselves but more so to protect each other.
"Once again, I urge everyone to please get vaccinated."
"We are doing this to save lives and because we must get on with the work to build our economic resilience, get people working and put our children back in the classrooms."
Last November we inherited an economy that was in decline well before the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.
"One that was near depression levels, levels not seen in almost 40 years, where the unemployment rate soared to almost 30 percent, with over 60,000 people out of a job, with the poverty rate surpassing 50 percent."
"These were clear evidence that our nation was being mismanaged or perhaps more appropriately, abandoned, but we did not allow ourselves to despair."
With the stellar efforts of the Minister of Agriculture and his team the export of cattle started almost from day one of the PUP administration.
Currently agriculture is leading the economic resurgence growing almost 25 percent in the second quarter of this year.
"Our small and large farmers are growing and producing more, and our people are responding by eating what we grow and produce."
"Through the tireless efforts of the Minister of Tourism and his team, tourism is not far behind growing by almost 20 percent in the second quarter as well."
"Our Minister for Infrastructure Development & Housing has assiduously pursued the repair, restoration, and improvement of our dilapidated road infrastructure."
Already over 976 miles of road and 18 bridges across this country have been repaired including those ravaged by the Eta and Iota floods of 2020.
"Over 311 miles of village streets, roads and farm roads have been resurfaced to support the rural areas and productive sector while another 15 miles of roads have been newly paved."
The Ministry has further renegotiated the terms of the Caracol road construction contract and the Haulover Bridge construction contract saving the Government upwards of 57 million dollars on those two contracts alone.
"Unemployment has fallen dramatically by 25,000 from over 64,000."
"Using old definitions of employment, this means that unemployment is down to roughly 11.2 percent of the labour force."
"Overall, our economy is now headed in the right direction experiencing an overall growth of over 22 percent in the second quarter and over 6 percent for the first six months of this year, more than triple what our IFI partners like the IMF expected."
"On the public finances, this government is no longer borrowing a million dollars a day."
"This reckless borrowing has been discontinued for almost six months now.  In addition, we have successfully reduced the Central Bank overdraft balance from $100 million to zero."
"In other words, we are no longer paying any interest as we no longer owe any monies on overdraft with the Central Bank."
"Thanks to the sacrifice of many, including our teachers and public officers, we have kept Government expenditures under check."
"The result of all this is that for the first four months of this fiscal year, we are now operating in the black not in the red."
"This is no doubt a tenuous position as we are early in the fiscal year, but it certainly is a positive sign of fiscal recovery and if this holds, we will fulfil our promise to public officers and teachers."
Our efforts in renegotiating the superbond are now public.
"As of September 14, we have formally launched our offer at a deep discount of 55 cents on each dollar of outstanding bonds issued to bondholders."
"We still have some ways to go to get that across the finish line, but we look forward to that day when we will finally be released from this noose hanging around our necks and to the substantial savings of almost half a billion dollars to the government and people of Belize."
"We also look forward to the issuance of the new Blue Bonds, which will enable us to set up a Marine Conservation Endowment Fund."
This fund in 20 years will grow to over 200 million Belize dollars and has been designed to ensure marine conservation project funding in perpetuity.
"If we are successful on this front, our debt to GDP ratio will reduce by a full 12 percent, moving us toward a sustainable debt path."
We would also enjoy cumulative cash flow relief over the period of this PUP administration of almost $130 million.
Our debt management efforts do not end there however as we explore other areas to restructure other government debt.
"In this regard, we are pleased to report that our close friend and partner in development, the Republic of China   Taiwan, has agreed to reschedule all ten of our loans with them amounting to more than $286 million by providing a principal moratorium on these loans for up to 3 years."
This will yield much needed cash flow relief.
"Today we are also pleased to report that with the steady prudential collaboration of the Central Bank and as the economy turns around and we get our fiscal house in order, the foreign exchange reserves are now at their highest point since the famous August of 2015 when the UDP administration agreed to pay over half a billion dollars for the botched nationalization of BTL."

This sweetheart settlement deal was agreed to be paid using our precious foreign exchange reserves.
"On 1st September 2021, under this PUP administration, the net foreign assets of the banking system reached $1.33 billion."
"For the first time ever, domestic banks’ net foreign assets have surpassed the half billion-dollar mark."
"Fellow citizens, our currency peg is no longer at risk."
There will be no devaluation under this PUP administration.
"As we progress to enhance private sector access to credit at cheaper rates, we are also moving to significantly improve the ease of doing business in Belize through reducing the cost of starting a business by over 40 percent."
Momentously at the celebration of our first anniversary of being elected to office we will hold the Belize Investment Summit 2021.

It is a first-of-its-kind event focusing on attracting and promoting investment for economic development in Belize.
"Under the theme: “Belize is Open for Business”, this summit is a call to both local and international investors for identifying opportunities and showcasing Belize’s readiness to support global investment through vastly improved service delivery."
"The Belize Investment Summit will bring together business investors from the four corners of our globe and will highlight industry development, technology and innovation and an improved business climate for safe, secure, and sustainable investments."
Our government has prioritized the economic development of our country by adopting and changing policies to create an environment that is conducive to doing business in Belize.
Just a couple weeks after our official launch our Investment Summit secretariat has received significant interest from local and international investors whose summary profiles suggest an interest in investment projects amounting to a total of 539 million Belize dollars.
These projects span a range of sectors from tourism to agri-business and agro-processing to manufacturing and aqua-culture.
"While Belizeans are resilient, we were not put on this earth merely to suffer, struggle, and survive."
Belizeans deserve more.
"This is what Plan Belize is all about, a better life."
"This is why for my government, “Ending Corruption” is not a slogan."
It is a demand we have heard loud and clear from the Belizean people across the length and breadth of our nation.
It is too a requirement for the successful growth and development of Belize.
It is the foundation of our Social Justice Agenda aimed at addressing poverty.
We will make Government more accountable and transparent by reforming the oversight structures and reviewing the Belize Constitution to ensure that it meets the needs and aspirations of the Belizean people.
"Today, I am announcing our government’s decision to appoint a Constitutional Reform Commission to undertake a comprehensive review of the Constitution, engage in national consultations, and make specific recommendations to the Ministry of Constitutional Reform for any changes deemed necessary."
The Commission shall be appointed on or before 31st October and have a one-year term of office.
"As efforts at reform continue, the Ministry of E-Governance recently passed major legislations that give life to Government’s plan to achieve and roll out its digital agenda and action plan that will see government services such as vital statistics, criminal records, land applications, e-passport services, and the creation of a national ID."
This is in context to our commitment to an open government through digital transformation for the benefit of all.
"Because we intended to address improvements in the delivery of justice three itinerant Judges have been appointed to the Court of Appeals and with the assistance of the Commonwealth, we will soon get 4 new justices who will assist with the backlog of cases in the criminal division of the Supreme Court."
"Today along with the Minister of Education I am also pleased to announce the launch of the EDUCATION UPLIFTMENT PILOT PROJECT: TOGETHER WE RISE, which is aimed at providing specific, targeted interventions in four (4) Government High Schools located in vulnerable, at-risk communities in Southside Belize City."
"This Project will see the rolling out of my Government’s Free Education Policy as set out in Plan Belize. We will also upgrade existing physical school infrastructure, expand feeding programs, provide counselling services, and improve training for teachers and staff of these institutions.  We will not fail these young Belizeans!"
"Through the Ministry of Human Development, Families and Indigenous Peoples Affairs efforts continue to improve social services and the credible equality and inclusion mandate of our Plan Belize with full respect for indigenous Belizeans, those with disability, the elderly, the vulnerable and those in greatest need."
"Our government works for the development of our people, and we are determined to make the lives of all Belizeans better."
"From Day One, we have been committed to take the lands department to the people."
We are not just waiting for election time to do it.
Our famed Land Mobile has been making its way across the country to our villages and towns   allowing thousands of our residents to receive their leases and purchase approvals and titles that in some cases they were waiting many years to receive.
"It has shown us what is possible when we concentrate our collective efforts on making sure that we are there for the people, ensuring that the ordinary man and woman get a piece of this beautiful Jewel of ours."
"Our planned initial roll out of 150 starter homes for first time homeowners, especially single moms has commenced."
"Already 22 homes are under construction in Cayo, Dangriga, Cow Pen Village and in Belize City."
Later this month the construction of 30 more homes for single parents will begin.  At the same time some of the dilapidated community houses in Belize City are undergoing much needed repairs.
These programs directly touch the lives of our most vulnerable citizens.

Ciudadanos
En el marco de los cuarenta años de la independencia de nuestro pueblo y cuando mi pueblo se siente doblegar ante una pandemia… hoy me dirijo a todo beliceño con un mensaje de mucha esperanza.
"Porque, aunque el panorama local e internacional parezca siniestro, en nuestra nación hemos logrado mucho."
Hemos logrado mucho porque el pueblo beliceño ha sabido cooperar y colaborar con los cambios enormes que se han hecho en todo aspecto de la vida diaria.
Por entender que en los tiempos difíciles todo se hace más tolerable cuando persistimos…el beliceño sabe que el dicho “al mal tiempo hay que hacerla buena cara” es muy cierto.
"El gobierno, en solo nueve meses, ha logrado adquirir las vacunas necesarias y asignado todos los recursos sanitarios requeridos para proteger a la mayor parte de nuestro pueblo."
Hemos asegurado la cordura fiscal y reactivado la economía y así poder ofrecerle al beliceño…la capacidad de encontrar un empleo para sostener a su familia dignamente.
"También hemos logrado devolverle confianza al sector privado y el sector empresarial, también nos ha dado todas las indicaciones que están dispuestos a invertir en un ecosistema económico estable y eficiente."
Hemos revertido el caos que el pasado gobierno nos heredó.
"Las bases para el crecimiento y desarrollo sostenible, no solo económico sino también social, se han sentado."
"Los primeros pasos para la transformación y el progreso se han dado…como dice el refrán español…” el primer paso no te lleva a donde quieres ir, pero te saca de donde estas”."
Así estamos hoy compatriotas…en miras de un mejor futuro y con el sueño que venceremos y que nos aguarda mejores tiempos.
"Celebremos hoy nuestra fortaleza, nuestra humanidad, nuestros esfuerzos y los logros que hemos obtenido a pesar de los grandes retos."

"Fellow Belizeans, our transformation has begun, we have set before us a path to a more prosperous future."
As a young nation at 40 we will restore confidence in our social and economic development.
"We will use all our energies to chart a new, better, and progressive course for our nation."
"And yes, we will defeat COVID."
"So, on this our Independence Day we stand together with hopeful hearts, steady hands and with the guidance of our Creator, we will build a Belize where everybody wins."

To Belizeans at home and abroad we say
Long Live Belize!
Que Viva Belice!
Happy Independence Day!
Thank you.


"Excellencies,"
I’m here as a Belizean and as a global citizen to call for solidarity.
"As a member of AOSIS, Belize is here to demand urgent action to combat climate change."
Climate change is the greatest challenge to humanity ─ devastating in its impacts on every aspect of our lives especially on those most vulnerable.
"It is increasing poverty, eroding land and other resources of low-lying islands and coastal states, and threatening food security and livelihoods for hundreds of millions, and for generations yet to come."
"Belize is the proud custodian of the Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System, the second largest reef system in the world and a UNESCO World Heritage Site."
But here is the sad reality.
The reef is under siege.
Coral bleaching stress doubled from 1.7 in the period 1985 to 2014 to severe level 3 between 2014 to 2017.
The reef is dying and may be beyond the point of full restoration.
Its loss will be irreversible.
"For Belize, the Barrier Reef is more than a global beauty; it also underpins our culture and our tourism industry which contributes approximately 40 percent to our gross domestic product."
"Without the reefs, Belize’s economy could crumble."
Our people’s lives will be forever changed.
"Excellencies, the threat to our Barrier Reef is a direct result of human induced climate change."
That is an undeniable fact.
Belize is doing what it can to slow the impacts.
But we are struggling to respond as those impacts continue to accelerate.
Belize’s annual average losses from extreme weather events are now approaching four percent of GDP.
Forced to accumulate an unsustainable debt load for disaster recoveries has become an unbearable cost.
"We all know however that acting together, we can, and we must."
We have a collective duty to do what’s right.
COP26 is a tipping point for climate action.
Belize is doing more than its fair share.
Belize is a net carbon sink.
Over 60 percent of our land has forest cover.
"More than 40 percent of which is protected for conservation and biodiversity, while roughly 15 percent of our marine area is under protection."
"Both on land and in the sea, we have exceeded conservation targets."
I am pleased to announce that Belize just entered a 360-million-dollar debt-for-marine conservation transaction.
The largest blue bond transaction ever.
And established a permanent $ 100 million US marine conservation trust fund.
"We will increase our marine protected biodiversity zones to 30 percent by 2026, four years ahead of target."
Belize is proud of our record on conservation.
"But all will be lost, if the countries of the G20 obfuscate, and abdicate their responsibilities to act."
"With right on our side, we demand climate justice."
We demand immediate action!
Ambitious action to save our planet.
"To date, NDCs of the major emitters are not in line with the objective of the Paris Agreement."
This places the world at risk of global warming close to three degrees.
"These same countries account for three-quarters of global emissions and 80 percent of global GDP, they channel trillions of dollars towards fossil fuels, while developed countries shirk their commitment to deliver a bare minimum of 100 billion US dollars per annum."
This is rank negligence.
We need to get serious.
Developed countries must not only deliver but increase their commitments on climate finance.
One hundred billion US dollars per year can only now serve as the baseline.
"Talk of reducing and averting loss and damage must give way to dedicated financial, technical, and capacity building support to address actual loss and damage in developing countries."
Funding for adaptation must be dramatically increased.
"At a minimum, developed countries need to more than double public finance for adaptation."
We need to move from carbon trading toward carbon emission reduction mechanisms with rules that apply to everyone.
"For this to work, credits should only be generated from activities within Nationally Determined Contributions."
"There should be no double counting of emission reduction credits, and a material share of proceeds should go to the Adaptation Fund, while a portion of credits canceled as a fundamental contribution to global emissions reductions."
"Now, let’s be clear."
"Net zero by 2050 will not get the G20 off the hook from halving emissions by 2030, the former means nothing without the latter."
New 1.5 aligned NDCs must be delivered before any stock-take if we are going to make meaningful progress on Paris. Or more bluntly if we are going to save lives.
"Mister President, the people of Belize and the developing world have heard enough talk, been disappointed by empty promises and are skeptical of pious pledges."
"Every dollar my country invests in climate action, G20 countries undo multiple times over with the trillions they invest in oil, coal and gas."
Every step forward we make on development is easily reversed by the failure of G20 countries to act in line with the Paris promise of 1.5.
Belize is taking ambitious action. But there are some amongst us with a much bigger duty to act.
"Mother Earth can wait no more, she can suffer no more, she is dying."
"Mister President, the world is watching."
People are awaiting the outcomes of COP26.
"This is the COP to stand with the vulnerable, to show you are for us not against us."
"We all know what we need to do, we must summon the courage and moral strength to act."
None of us can afford to fail.
Thank you.


"Madam Speaker,"
"I rise to present Government’s Estimates of Revenues and Expenditure for the Fiscal Year 2022/2023, and to report on the performance of the National Budget for the current Fiscal Year 2021/2022."
What has been achieved in our first budget year is truly remarkable.
"Across the land, a new day is dawning, the economy is bouncing back, Belizeans are returning to work in larger numbers than ever before, the Belize dollar is strong again, default and devaluation have been averted and the confidence of the State and those she serves is being restored."
"Today, with pride, I will share a progress report unmatched in our 41 years as an independent nation. The storyline is of a macroeconomic and fiscal house on fire when we took office less than 16 months ago, transformed now to a house whose rehabilitation is outclassing its regional peers and overshooting expectations."
"I remind this Assembly of what our Administration inherited. An economy weighed down by corruption and incompetence, withering from prolonged recession, battered by COVID-19 lockdowns, strangled by rocketing debt and deficits, squeezed by costly credit, beset with surging unemployment, and bereft of self-belief and common-sense solutions."
"Belize’s 2021 national economic rebound may be as high as 12.5 percent according to the IMF, twice the rate of the Latin America and Caribbean regions. In fact, save for Guyana and its crude oil bonanza, Belize is the fastest growing economy amongst all countries in North, Central and South America and the Caribbean.  Our overall budget performance for this fiscal year will be $527 million better than the last fiscal year. The country’s 174 thousand-strong employed labour force is the highest ever. A well-capitalized banking system brims with almost $700 million of liquidity, poised to fund a private sector boom. Public debt is being slashed with precedent-setting ingenuity. And, 4.6 months of import cover in Central Bank reserves buttress the Belize dollar."
"My report today will show that our first Budget exceeded all performance markers and that the new Budget, proposed at $1.361 billion, will be the largest spending and investment Budget in the history of our country. And we have managed to prudently and responsibly configure this new Budget with a primary surplus."
"These are remarkable achievements which properly belong to all Belizeans, and particularly result from Government’s vibrant partnership with commerce and industry; its collaboration with public sector employees and their larger number in the private sector; and its cooperation with Belize’s unique network of developmental NGOs."
"I acknowledge not only the positive evolution of these crucial domestic alliances but also, the rapid re-setting of relations with our Official Sector and bilateral supporters. The pipeline of project funding, the envelope of grant financing is more generous, more diverse than ever before. Our international partners, like investors, can see clearly that this Administration is focused, determined to nurture an equitable prosperity, and committed to the highest standards of governance."
"To say it plain, Madam Speaker, we have put our house in order, strengthen the state of the nation, restored our reputation in the region and we are indeed delivering on Plan Belize."
The Regional and Domestic Context
"The global economy recovered markedly from the adverse effects of COVID-19 in 2021. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected that world output would increase by 5.9 percent in 2021, following a deep 3.1 percent contraction in 2020. Nevertheless, the global growth momentum faced stiff headwinds along the way. Economies worldwide were hit hard by (i) the emergence of new COVID-19 variants, (ii) pandemic outbreaks and weather disruptions that led to major supply disruptions in the production and movement of goods, and (iii) rising food and energy prices triggered by the intensification of global imbalances. On average, advanced economies reportedly grew by 5.2 percent, while emerging and developing countries expanded faster by 6.4 percent in 2021."
"Among major advanced economies, the real gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States (U.S.) increased by 5.7 percent in the previous year."
"Closer to home, the Latin America and the Caribbean region posted a 6.3 percent rebound for the year. Economies in Central America grew by 5.5 percent in 2021 after contracting 6.0 percent in 2020. The upswing occurred against a backdrop of heightened commodity prices alongside historical levels of remittances, which provided significant support to households during a time of severe hardship. According to the World Bank, remittance inflows to Latin America and the Caribbean increased by 21.6 percent in 2021 and likely surpassed the sum of foreign direct investment and overseas development assistance to the region."
"The easing of health restrictions and higher vaccination rates amid new COVID-19 variants in major source markets anchored growth in the region. Positive economic growth was recorded in all Central America. Nicaragua had the lowest output in Central America at 2.5 percent, while El Salvador and Panama witnessed robust growth rates of 7.5 percent and 12.0 percent, respectively. Mexico’s economy grew by 6.2 percent, stimulated by agricultural and manufactured exports and was the principal source of record-high remittance inflows."
"In the Caribbean region, the Caribbean Development Bank estimated that Caribbean economies grew by 3.0 percent in 2021. Like in the other geographical areas, the nascent recovery among states was uneven. Service-exporting economies reportedly grew by 3.2 percent, slightly faster than commodity exporters’ 2.7 percent growth pace. Service economies rebounded gradually from the pick-up in international travel which, in turn, fueled domestic consumption as vaccination rollouts became more widespread, border restrictions were relaxed, and lockdown measures eased."
"Underpinned by an upsurge in oil production, Guyana’s economy expanded by roughly 20.0 percent. However, the economies of Trinidad and Tobago and Suriname both recorded modest contractions, emanating from the commodity sectors of their respective nations."
The Belize Context
Real Sector Developments
"According to recent estimates by the IMF, Belize’s economy expanded by 12.5 percent in 2021 relative to 2020. The SIB’s preliminary number is just below 10 percent. This impressive performance follows a 16.7 percent decline the year before when the country faced severe pandemic-related economic losses, marking one of the most significant GDP swings since independence and among service-based economies within this region. Let us not forget that since 2019, the Belizean economy was already in recession. More so considering the economy was already mired in a prolonged recession prior to the Coronavirus pandemic."
"According to the Central Bank of Belize,  the reasons for the spectacular 2021 GDP growth achievement, were (i) the timely reopening of the economy, (ii) a strong vaccination campaign, and (iii) a resurgence in agricultural production from weather-related shocks, each of these being deliberate policies pursued by Government."
"Output in the primary sector of the economy expanded robustly. This sector grew by 11.2 percent, with significant contributions from the agriculture and livestock industries and fishing to a lesser extent. Agricultural output soared, as banana production rebounded strongly from the wake of Hurricane Nana in September 2020 to a new seven-year high. Sugarcane deliveries to processors in the north and west reached an all-time high with increased investments in new commercial production acreage for the latter. Livestock output grew, as cattle exports to Mexico and Guatemala doubled after lifting trade restrictions in late 2020. Poultry and pork production strengthened firmly in tandem with the recovery in domestic consumption. In the fisheries sub-sector, increased lobster, and conch hauls more than compensated for the reduction in farmed shrimp output, which continued to be challenged by the devastating effects of the Early Mortality Syndrome."
"I commend Minister Abelardo Mai and his team for their superlative work during this year. In such a short period of time, they have managed to reverse the persistent decline in a sector that was abandoned and stymied under the previous Administration."
"Production in the secondary sector contracted slightly by 1.2 percent, as a steep contraction in electricity generation weighed down value-added gains from food manufacturing and construction activities. Positively, manufacturing activity grew by 5.7 percent, with notable contributions from the sugar and beverage industries. The resumption of major private and public capital projects led to a substantial 15.1 percent expansion in construction activities. However, these improvements were eclipsed by an 18.2 percent dip in electricity and water supply output."
"The services sector grew by 10.1 percent reversing a devastating negative growth of 20.2 percent in 2020.  This spectacular outcome was because of the recovery in the overnight tourism, following the opening of the Philip Goldson International Airport in mid-2020. Stay-over arrivals increased by 58.9 percent in 2021 generating positive spin-off effects in the tourism and travel related sub-sectors. Cruise line services, which started in July 2021, led to 200,000 cruise passengers coming ashore to visit our destinations. Lastly, the increase in local spending boosted trade in the wholesale and retail distribution sectors by 22 percent while Government expenditure cuts to reduce fiscal deficits caused a 14.7 percent decline in Government services."
Employment
"According to the Central Bank, job opportunities improved amid pandemic-related disruptions and Government’s myriad efforts to drive up employment opportunities. The unemployment rate fell to 9.2 percent in September 2021, which was 4.5 percentage points better than a year ago. This outcome resulted as the number of people who gained employment outpaced the number of additional people seeking work. Between September 2021 and April 2021, the number of unemployed persons fell by 13.2 percent facilitated by the robust turnaround in economic performance. Employment growth was concentrated among service industries, many of which experienced severe economic dislocation during the early part of the crisis. Accordingly, the service sector registered a 16.5 percent increase in new hiring over the six-month period with most of the new employment opportunities recorded in the tourism, distributive trade, and real estate industries. Meanwhile, the labour force participation rate rose by 2.2 percentage points to 61.9 percent, as many of the displaced individuals sought to re-join the labour force, spurred by the resumption in many business activities."
"But this was not the only reason for the job improvement situation, Madam Speaker.  The ingenuity of the Belizean people also gave rise to a new form of self-employment as numerous Belizeans started a myriad of small jobs from designer face masks to food delivery; from online retail design services to new forms of internet entertainment in music, comedy to other forms of performance art."
The External Sector
"Turning to the external sector, the external current account deficit on the balance of payments for the first nine months of 2021 widened slightly. The deficit edged up by merely 0.1 percentage point of GDP to 3.8 percent of GDP, or $127.3 million.   For sure there was a strong growth in imports, however, this was offset by the growth in tourism revenue, other service export receipts, and inward remittances. Merchandise imports rose on account of three factors:"
"* heightened demand for goods to support the economic recovery,"
"* increased costs of goods in source countries, precipitated by escalating global inflation rates, and"
"* rising international shipping costs, exacerbated by supply disruptions abroad."
Net financial inflows exceeded $200.0 million and included an extraordinary $72.6 million allocation of Special Drawing Rights from the IMF in August 2021 to supplement the country’s reserves.
The initiative by the IMF was essentially to help countries build resilience to balance of payments shocks and ensure a sustainable recovery in the aftermath of the pandemic.
"By year end, Belize’s gross official international reserves had increased by $132.2 million to $830.0 million, equivalent to 4.6 months of import coverage."
Monetary and Financial Sector Developments
"Dynamics within the monetary and financial system development were also shaped by effects of the pandemic and the recession we inherited. Broad money supply grew rapidly, accelerating by 12.3 percent in 2021, the fastest growth pace on record since 2008. According to the Central Bank, this outcome was driven by a sharp upturn in net foreign assets of the banking system, which reached $1.4bn at year-end. Almost two-thirds of the $444.2 million increase in net foreign balances was due to a doubling in domestic banks’ holdings to a year-end high of $596.5 million."
"This unprecedented growth in domestic banks’ foreign asset balances underscored: (i) the rebound in tourism revenue, (ii) a boom in call centre receipts, (iii) a surge in remittance inflows, (iv) a surge in direct foreign investment, and (v) a resurgence in Corozal Free Zone sales, following the reopening of storefronts on 1 February 2021. I stress that each of the growth factors for this unprecedented increase in the foreign holdings of the commercial banks is the handiwork of our administration."
"Furthermore, in response to the unprecedented economic shock, the Central Bank and domestic banks implemented stricter controls on foreign currency usage to enhance banks’ shock-absorbing capacity and minimize risks to the monetary and financial system. In addition to the boom at domestic banks, the Central Bank’s net foreign assets expanded by $148.5 million in 2021. For the second consecutive year, the monetary authority’s foreign asset position registered an increase in reserves that exceeded $140.0 million."
"The next major component of money supply, net domestic credit, grew at a much more modest pace against the backdrop of the ongoing crisis and new fiscal consolidation efforts. Net domestic credit expanded by 0.2 percent in 2021 when compared to the year before. This marginal uptick in credit resulted as bank lending to the real economy moderated, while the Government’s borrowings from the banking system declined in an effort to widen its fiscal space. Encouragingly, domestic bank lending to the private sector increased by $43.6 million in 2021, down slightly from $47.4 million in 2020. New loans to support the economic recovery were channeled mainly to the tourism, construction, and agricultural sectors. Domestic bank forbearance measures to reduce borrowers’ debt service costs amid the economic fallout continued throughout the year. In 2021, domestic banks granted creditors $151.0 million in additional loan forbearances, raising the total of forbearances granted through this prudential policy measure to $858.5 million since the onset of the pandemic."
"Domestic bank liquidity expanded further in 2021. Boosted by the foreign asset expansion, excess liquidity rose by $230.6 million to $698.3 million, while excess cash reserves strengthened by $63.8 million to $415.6 million in 2021. Borrowing costs inched up marginally as credit conditions tightened, and as expected during any prolonged period of severe economic shock. In 2021, the weighted average lending rate rose by 13 basis points on account of marginal rate hikes in personal, residential construction, and other miscellaneous loan categories. Furthermore, the skewed liquidity distribution contributed to a two-basis point lift in the weighted average deposit rate to 2.05 percent. As a result, the weighted average interest rate spread widened by 11 basis points for the year."
Recall the prediction by the previous Prime Minister when he proclaimed to the nation that he wept for Belize in fear of devaluation.  Due mainly I must say to he and his government irresponsible spending plan which was that they would borrow until they could borrow no more.
You see madam speaker there is a huge difference between the incipience of their administration who had so much and did so little and our administration who did so much with so little.  Imagine what we would have done for our nation with the hundreds of millions in oil revenues and what they called the Petro Caribe Bonanza.  What we have done in our short term in office to restore confidence in our monetary system and in strengthening the Belizean dollar is in stark contrast to what they did to put our financial system in peril.
Economic Prospects for 2022
"The global growth momentum observed in 2021 is expected to recede in 2022. According to the IMF, global growth is expected to weaken by 1.5 percentage points to 4.4 percent in 2022. Economies worldwide will be challenged to improve the welfare of their citizens while facing: (i) disruptions caused by new COVID-19 variants, (ii) high inflation stimulated by ongoing supply chain disruptions and escalating food and energy prices, (iii) withdrawals of extraordinary monetary and fiscal stimulus, implemented to mitigate the economic fallout, (iv) rising geopolitical hostilities with significant negative spillovers across the world, (v) large debt overhangs exacerbated by the crisis, and (vi) adverse weather events."
"This crisis and the ongoing recovery are unprecedented. Like in the rest of the global community, Belize’s growth pace is projected to moderate in the upcoming year, following the strong rebound in 2021. The Central Bank of Belize projects that the country’s GDP will likely expand around 6.0 percent in 2022, the IMF’s projection is 6.5 percent growth. The projected output largely reflects a slowdown in the growth of agricultural production as the boost from weather-related improvements the year before dissipates, and the upturn in tourist arrivals tempers given the solid outturn recorded last year."
Fiscal Year 2021/2022 PERFORMANCE
"Madam Speaker,"
"The projected performance for Fiscal Year 2021/22 is nothing short of spectacular, in terms of the overall Budget outturn, and especially in terms of revenue resilience."
"On the revenue front, total Recurrent Revenue is projected at $1.048 billion, which, when added to $50m in grants and $5.36 million in capital revenues, produce Total Revenue and Grants of $1.192 billion. This performance is 19 percent or $194m higher than the budgeted number and therefore almost double the rate of GDP expansion for 2021."
"All four broad categories of Tax Revenues recorded increases, with taxes on International Trade and Transactions and Taxes on Goods and Services were the star performers, exceeding budgeted levels by 27 percent and 24 percent, respectively."
Non-Tax Revenue exceeded the budgeted amount by about $7 million or 9 percent.
"The exceptional Grants funding line of $50m is almost entirely the result of the immense generosity of the people and Government of the Republic of China Taiwan. In my recent visit to Taipei, accompanied by various Members of the Cabinet, I had the opportunity to express the enduring gratitude of the Government and people of Belize for the imperishable fraternity shared by our two nations."
"On the expenditure side, total spending is projected at $1.217 billion, or $14 million higher than budgeted. Recurrent Expenditure exceeded Budget limits in 4 of 5 categories. In the case of Wages and Pensions, the excess was by 2 percent of the budgeted levels. In the case of debt service, the $19 million in projected additional spending represents the first Blue Bond payments and is a fraction of the debt service payments foregone for the previous two Budget cycles."
"Now the excess spending in the instance of Goods and Services is the item of greatest concern to me: $50m or some 29 percent higher than the Budget. While we concede that the cut for FY 2021/22 was significant, compared to previous years, there must be an acceptance that spending 20 cents of every dollar collected by Government on Goods & Services is intolerably high."
The Ministry of Finance will redouble efforts to suppress this expenditure line item but to do so requires an all-of-government approach. I appeal to Ministries and Financial Officers to exercise maximum restraint.
"Capital spending is projected to total $243 million, about 19 percent less than budgeted levels, this being attributable to the uneven implementation schedule for certain capital projects, especially for drawing down on Capital III funding lines."
"At the bottom line, this Budget’s Primary balance will be $197 million or 5.71 percent of GDP better than forecasted and the Overall Budget Balance, $179 million or 5.37 percent of GDP better than forecasted."
"Finally, in this fiscal year, Government expects to retire $86.4 million in public debt, separate and apart from the write-offs related to the Super Bond discounted buyout. Based on revenue and spending performance, Government’s total borrowing for this Budget is now projected at $112.1 million, which is $211 million less than the $323.8 million approved by the National Assembly."
PUBLIC DEBT
"Turning to the management and trajectory of the public debt, Madam Speaker, my Administration is unmatched."
"We promised to resolve, once and for all, the Super Bond quagmire and we delivered in our first year in office."
"Since October of last year, when this Honorable House endorsed the Blue Bond for Conservation initiative, Belize has been the toast of the sustainable finance universe, heralded for the innovation and boldness of a transaction that achieved three simultaneous objectives:"
"* first, reduction of our public indebtedness by over half a billion dollars or 45 percent of the value of the Super Bond;"
"* second, a renewed commitment to marine conservation, including, protecting 30 percent of our ocean space;"
"* and third, establishing a reliable, multi-generational, marine conservation funding mechanism valued in the hundreds of millions."
"At the COP 26 Conference in Glasgow, Scotland last November, and in the days since, Belize’s debt restructuring model has provided a template for sovereign debt workouts that address humanity’s climate crisis, with countries like Sri Lanka, Ecuador, Argentina, Bolivia, among others following suit in some form or the other."
"According to the IMF’s most recent assessment, issued on 24th February 2022, Belize’s public debt fell from 133 percent of GDP at the close of 2020 to 108 percent at the close of 2021, down by a massive 25 percent of GDP."
I quote: “Significant progress towards restoring debt sustainability was made in 2021.”
"That is the independent judgment of the IMF Staff on this Government’s debt management performance. Just a year ago, Belize was labeled a serial defaulter, facing the very real prospect of a painful IMF Program and possible currency devaluation. A year later, optimism abounds that Belize has opened an exciting new chapter:"
"* the currency peg rescued,"
"* the reserves robust, its reputation transformed with the emergence of Brand Belize as a leading climate-conscious nation, and the future flush with immense potential."
"* In dollar terms, when 2020 ended, Belize owed over $4.2 billion dollars, a debt stock that has now been reduced to just under $4 billion just one year later."
"* Of what Belize currently owes, external debt totals BZ$ 2.7 billion or some 72 percent of 2021 GDP while 36 percent of GDP or some BZ$ 1.3 billion is owed to domestic creditors."
"Apart from resolving the Super Bond, I wish to highlight three other major debt management achievements in 2021:"
"First, during this Fiscal Year, Government paid off over $90 million in Overdraft advances previously held with the Central Bank, eliminating the interest expense on that debt."
"Second, for the first time since 2014, when the domestic debt stood at $376 million, Government domestic debt balance was reduced. Let me underline this point: in the seven years, between 2014 and 2020, the previous Administration borrowed one billion dollars from domestic sources alone, a jaw-dropping average of $143m per year ($2.75 Million per week). In 2021, my Administration reduced the outstanding domestic debt by $59.2 million."
"And third, the Ministry of Finance commissioned, for the first time, a comprehensive assessment of domestic debt, with the objective of reducing Government’s cost of borrowing which currently stands at an average coupon rate of 3.3 percent. Based on this analysis, through market-based yield curve management, a phased re-pricing for new issues of both Treasury Bills and Notes should gradually lower interest payments on the domestic debt stock while at the same time lowering the benchmark for interest rates for the entire financial system thereby incentivizing lending and economic activity."
"For the new Fiscal Year, interest payments on the public debt are expected to rise by BZD 24.1 million, from $87.8 million to $111.9 million. For two years, Belize made no payments on external commercial debt, capitalizing this obligation in 2020 and including interest accrued in the Super Bond settlement last year. Blue Bond-related payments commenced in 2022. Even so, interest payments represent only 9 cents of every recurrent revenue dollar and even less   8 cents   of every dollar spent. And our medium-term forecast suggests that debt service payments will remain at this manageable level: below 10 cents per recurrent revenue dollar for the ensuing 4-year horizon."
"Now, let’s be clear. The public debt emergency is not over. Servicing a public debt of $3.9 billion is a heavy burden which directs funds away from people-centered priorities such as education, sports, health, housing, and citizen security. Virtually half of the $4.2 billion debt load accrued before our debt reduction efforts was accumulated during the 13 years of the UDP."
This PUP Administration cannot undo 13 years of UDP mismanagement and corruption in a single year.
But I reiterate our firm target for a debt to GDP ratio of 85 percent by Fiscal Year 2025/26 and 70 percent by 2030/31.
ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN 2020/2021
"Due to our fiscal performance in 2020/2021 and even as we worked to put our financial house in order, we did not fail to deliver on Plan Belize."
"Provisional data reveal that 1.535 new businesses were established in 2021 many of them by young entrepreneurs. This may be as a result of the financing that Government made available for MSMEs through the National Bank of Belize and the Development Finance Cooperation, which targeted mainly women and young people."
"The Belize Investment Summit held November 10th and 11th 2021, a first of its kind event, focused on attracting and promoting investment for economic development in Belize.  This high-profile occasion was led by the Office of the Prime Minister and the Ministry of Investment under the theme: “Belize is Open for Business”. This was a call to both local and international investors for identifying opportunities and for the government to showcase Belize’s readiness to support global investment through vastly improved service delivery."
"Our country boasts exceptional and untapped growth potential and having a wealth of opportunities in areas, such as Agriculture, Tourism, Blue Economy, Business Process Outsourcing, Manufacturing and Renewable Energy these were highlighted at our first Investment Summit. Coupled with the great success of the Blue Bond, the limitless opportunities in the green and blue economies garnered great interest and excitement among investors."
"As Prime Minister, I am convinced that the Summit was done at the opportune time to invite investors to Belize. It was an opportunity for foreign and local investors to establish strategic partnerships and find investment opportunities. Post the Belize Investment Summit we are now starting to experience the tangible benefits of increased investment in our economy."
"As it relates to the coronavirus, our vaccine rollout was robust and close to 50 percent of our population has been fully vaccinated.  I appeal again to those not yet vaccinated to please do so, vaccines save lives and is the only way we will defeat COVID."
"You have all seen the many thousands of Belizeans who have benefitted from the outreach program instituted across towns and villages.  Our Deputy Prime Minister and his team at the Ministry of Natural Resources, Petroleum and Mining have been determined and diligent in taking the Lands Department to the people, wherever they are.  In cities, towns and far-flung villages   as far south as Bella Vista and Punta Gorda, and as far north as San Joaquin and Corozal Town, last year alone 8 Land Mobile Clinics brought Belmopan to thousands of Belizeans who have otherwise been stymied and denied the services of the Lands Department over the previous 13 years."
"As a result of their efforts, more than 7,895 leases, grants and purchase approvals to ordinary Belizeans ─ including teachers, nurses, soldiers, police officers, single mothers and fathers, the employed and unemployed, and students and the elderly ─ were distributed. This coming year the Ministry of Natural Resources is committing to issuing another 8,000 lots to first-time landowners. We are budgeting a $1 million for the survey of additional lots in every district of this beautiful country of ours."
"In infrastructure development, rural roads have undergone improvements, our highways and bridges continue to be rehabilitated and plans for road and highway expansion are in the works."
"After years and years of talk by the UDP, the long-awaited Haulover Bridge Construction Project has commenced at a price tag of close to 20 million dollars less than was budgeted for by the previous administration, free from hustle and political cronyism."
"In our first year alone, over 167 houses have been built for single mothers and first-time homeowners. Good homes that will last for generations and will help to lift those 167 families out of poverty and restore dignity to their lives."
"Millions of dollars were issued in scholarships, not to political cronies, but to deserving Belizean students. This compliments the many international scholarships for our deserving students in countries like Taiwan, Cuba, Mexico, the U.S., Europe and South America."
"And Madam Speaker we have restored Belize’s reputation internationally.  Through the efforts of our foreign ministry, we have begun our work of active participation at the UN and the OAS, in regional organizations Belize is once again seated at the table in CARICOM and SICA.  Our recent CARICOM Summit and our CARICOM/SICA Summit, which had the participation of the UN Secretary-General, is setting the pace for Belize enhancing its role as the bridge between Central America and the Caribbean."
"As it relates to our efforts at success in bringing a final and definitive end to the long-standing claim by Guatemala over our sovereignty and territorial integrity, we are well on pace to present our response to Guatemala’s claim now at the ICJ."
This is but a fraction of the work we have done in delivering on our promise to the people and we have only just begun.
"As it relates to our reform agenda, we established a reformed Public Accounts Committee and I urge Chairman Tracy Panton the member for Albert to get on with the work of this important committee."
"In the Attorney General’s Ministry, much has been done in the improvement of our judicial and legal services:"
We now have two virtual courtrooms.
"A law library has been established at the Attorney General’s Ministry.  Through the generous assistance of Belize Electricity Limited, important law books and treaties have been acquired so that our crown counsels can be fully prepared to argue in our courts."
"We produced the 2020 Revised Laws of Belize, which is an update from the 2011 Revised Edition."
An informative website is now being provided with information about the services of the ministry including free access to the 2020 Revised Laws of Belize.
We have expanded the current units to create a Legal Advice Unit set up to provide full-time access to government offices for legal advice.
Additional staff has been provided in Legislative Drafting Unit and in the Litigation Unit.
Specialized training is being provided to the Crown Counsels in the Legislative Drafting Unit.
"We are expanding Legal Aid with human resources, to expand firstly to Corozal and thereafter to the West and Southern Belize."
"With the assistance of Impact Justice, we are in the process of revising the Subsidiary Laws of Belize, which has not been revised for some 19 years."
We are restructuring the upper courts and in due course will be tabling the Senior Courts Bill.
"We have appointed three Justices of Appeal to the Court of Appeal, with two more scheduled to be appointed in June 2022 and acquired four judges for the Supreme Court, to clear backlog."
"We have appointed four new magistrates, acquired software to facilitate the online filing of court documents for Court of Appeal and for the Supreme Court, acquired hardware to enable virtual court hearings for the criminal division and to facilitate witness testimony from the Kolbe Foundation.  Soon we will be introducing new rules for the Family and Probate Division of the Supreme Court to modernize the practice in these courts."
All this in partial fulfilment of our Plan Belize promise to deliver affordable access and speedier trials and restoring the independence of the judiciary.
During the budget debate my colleagues will expand on this list of accomplishments that were made in 2021.
Fiscal Year 2022/2023: THE NEW BUDGET
Summary Estimates for 2022//2023
"Madam Speaker,"
"Belize is a small, open and therefore fragile economy. So many of the factors that determine our fiscal fortunes are beyond our control. These factors include inflation, interest rates, the cost of fuel and energy, climate change, the terms for trade and commerce, to mention just a few. In assembling the Budget for Fiscal Year 2022/23, not only have these factors weighed heavily upon our considerations but another concern stood foremost in our collective thinking: the fragility of our economic and fiscal recovery from devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic."
"From both a revenue and spending standpoint, Government must be cautious. Therefore, there is no new, major tax revenue measure in this Budget. Yes, we will seek to close certain tax loopholes, to adjust collections for activities such as in the lotteries sector, that are not fairly contributing, and to aggressively enforce the current revenue mandate."
"On the spending side, the new Budget restores the wage levels of FY 2020/21 to public officers and teachers, maintains fairly even other recurrent spending lines and re-prioritizes capital investments to align with several major social justice goals of the Plan Belize Blueprint."
Details for the Budget for Fiscal Year 2022/23
"Recurrent Revenues are projected at $1.122 billion, which is 7.5 percent or $86 million higher than the forecasted outturn for this fiscal year. Both Tax and Non-Tax revenues are projected to rise while Capital Revenues will remain constant, and Grants will fall to $35 million, in line with our bilateral agreements."
Revenue growth is consistent with the 6.5 percent overall GDP growth forecast of the IMF for 2022 and the Central Bank’s slightly more modest 6 percent growth forecast.
"On the Expenditure side, overall spending will rise compared to this year’s projected outturn by $144 million or 12 percent. These increases include the following major spending lines:"
"Ø Wages and Pensions will rise by a combined 10 percent, or some $49 million, most of this attributable to the 10 percent wage restoration which is to commence on July first."
"Ø Subsidies and Transfers will rise by $37 million, or 25 percent, which is mostly indirect wage subsidies linked to the wage restoration."
"Ø Debt service will rise by $24 million, as we commence interest payments on the Blue Bonds."
Ø Capital Spending will rise by $30 million compared to this year’s outturn of $243 million.
"I will address in more detail the issues of wages, pensions, and capital spending priorities."
"In summary, therefore, the new Budget targets a Primary Surplus of some $14 million, or 0.35 percent of GDP, along with an overall deficit of $98.1 million or 2.49 percent of GDP."
"Government proposes to retire $97.4 million in public debt during this budget cycle. Total financing required for this Budget Year will be $195.6 million, to be sourced from the following lenders:"
"$84 million from Taiwan, being a portion of a $150 million loan in pursuance of our MOU with them, and"
$98 million disbursements from International Financial Institutions in support of our Capital II Program; and $13 million from the domestic system financed through new issue of Government treasury securities.
"Outside these academic numbers, which must be recited for consistency, I punctuate, with just a few examples what this Budget does for all Belizeans:"
"Ø It employs 15,000 public officers and teachers who collectively provide 35.1 million work hours of public service during the Budget period;"
"Ø The Budget underwrites national sovereignty and citizen security through the roles of the Belize Defence Force, the Belize Police Department and the Coast Guard;"
"Ø The Budget funds the functioning of the Judiciary, thereby providing the mechanisms for law and order in our country;"
"Ø The Budget pays for 181 Government schools, contributes to another 381 grant-aided schools, supports some level of direct scholarship funding for 4,000 students at the tertiary level and effectively bankrolls the national education system, from kinder to UB for 102,679 students; and this Budget will provide an additional $2 million for Youth and Sporting Programs."
"Ø Our National Referral Hospital, regional hospitals and clinics, and the entire public health system is subsidized by this Budget;"
"Ø The Budget funds the national infrastructure system, maintaining 527 miles of paved roads, 2,294 of gravel surface roads, 300 bridges, not to mention the entirety of new infrastructure projects;"
"Ø Rural development, the land registry and land surveys, the provision of passports, the facilitation of trade and investments, the regulation of every sector from tourism to aviation to agriculture is, to some degree, subsidized by the national Budget."
"Whether you live, go to school or work in any of our two cities, seven towns or almost 200 villages, this Budget touches your life positively in some way or another."
"What distinguishes this new Budget, and the current one, is the extent to which my Administration strives to collect the people’s revenues, strives to secure value for money in spending and strives to ensure that in the main, the People’s Budget is an instrument for equitable national development and prosperity."
IMPACTS OF the NEW BUDGET
"Madam Speaker,"
"To address our principled priorities, I wish to outline just a few of the pertinent capital spending targets that will be enabled by this Budget, first with those that are funded from external loan and grant resources   the so-called Capital III Program:"
"* $4.0 million for continuation of the Strengthening of Tax Administration and for the full rollout of the IRIS (Integrated Revenue Information Systems), a multi-year program supported by the IDB."
"* $1.0 million for the Strengthening of Public Expenditure Management, also supported by the IDB."
"* $13.5 million to the Education Sector to improve access, equity and quality in our all-important Education System, supported jointly by the IDB and CDB."
"* $2.0 million of additional funds for the COVID -19 response   for purchase and administration of the Vaccine program, this supported by the World Bank."
* $1.5 million for the new Climate Resilient and Sustainable Agriculture Program (CRESAP) to be funded by the World Bank.
"* $3.5 million for the Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building in our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Trade, and Immigration, this support provided by the Government of the Republic of China on Taiwan."
"* $1.5 million for Sustainable Tourism, to fortify this anchor industry, supported by the IDB."
"* $68.0 million, in aggregate, for the transformative Road Infrastructure Program, including continued work on the upgrading of the Coastal Road, the Caracol Road, the George Price Highway, the Philip Goldson Highway, and for a new Haulover Bridge   just to name a few of the main infrastructure projects currently underway."
"* $8.0 million for the Integral Security Program funded by CABEI, to include new police stations for the twin town of San Ignacio/Santa Elena and for Caye Caulker; a new dormitory at Price Barracks; a crime-reduction, state of the art surveillance system in Belize City; new office, transport and communications equipment for the police and the BDF; a new deep-water vessel for the Coast Guard and a new medical center at Fairweather Camp in Punta Gorda."
* $3.0 million for the Resilient Rural Belize Program funded by the IFAD to support our agricultural sector through development of climate-smart agriculture and rural infrastructure;
"But the list does not end there, Madam Speaker:"
Under the Capital II Program ─ that is the local capital programs which are funded from our own resources ─ we are making the following investment provisions:
* $ 1.5 million to commence work on the Electoral Re-Districting Program.
* $6.0 million for the continuation of the Constituency Development Program which touches all 31 Constituencies;
"* $ 9.2 million to meet our Conservation Funding commitments under the Blue Bond Debt for Marine Protection Swap Program, of which 40 percent should flow to public sector agencies involved in marine conservation programs;"
* $7.0 million for COVID -19 response if this is required;
"* $1.0 million for Survey and Mapping of the 8,000 new lots to be distributed this year, and a further $12.0 million under the Land Development /Land Acquisition Program;"
"* $6.0 million under Social Assistance to provide food support to the urban and rural poor, and to the most vulnerable groups in our population;"
"* $24.2 million for maintenance of highways, streets and drains, rural roads, and feeder roads;"
* $5.0 million for the purchase of heavy equipment and vehicles for the Ministry of Infrastructure Development   as the ministry builds its own in-house Road Construction/ Rehabilitation Unit that will more efficiently and cost effectively upgrade and maintain rural and village roads countrywide;
"* $14.8 million for local counterpart contributions to some of the major road rehabilitation projects financed from foreign sources including the Caracol Road, the Coastal Road, and the Haulover Bridge;"
* $5.0 million for Low-Income Housing Assistance.
"This year, Government also proposes to commence implementation of the long-overdue expansion of the National Health Insurance Program, the NHI.  Healthcare, especially community-based, preventative care is the backbone of a vibrant, industrious, and healthy population. NHI is the brainchild of the last PUP Administration and 14 years later, we return to finish the good thing we started.  So, this initiative is the expansion of the Program to certain areas of the country that do not currently have access, as well as to increase the number of registered participants in those areas that are currently in the Program but that have long ago reached the maximum intake by service providers."
"To expand the Program, we include an additional provision of $3.2 million this year, elevating the total allocation now to $22 million for the NHI. This will enable the commencement of the roll out of services to the Orange Walk District, expand the range of healthcare coverage for the Corozal District, as well as raising the current limits on the number of NHI participants from Belize City’s Southside."
"Madam Speaker,"
"the Ministries of Health and Finance are actively seeking ways to fund the Program permanently and fully, on a national level and our goal is for this fully funded, national program to be operational by the end of this first term of office."
Tax Recovery
"Madam Speaker,"
"There has been much speculation about outstanding, uncollected taxes. This issue, rightly, gained much attention from the Unions in the circumstances where wages for public officers and teachers were reduced for this fiscal year. I had insisted that the Unions bear in mind, as they leveled their random assessment on this issue, two factors: first, that whatever taxes remained uncollected was on the account of the previous administration and second, that public officers, not Ministers, were responsible for all tax collections. Therefore, the criticism of uncollected taxes was effectively self-criticism."
"Cabinet committed to establishing a Tax Recovery Unit. This Unit began operations in October of last year. With help from CARTAC, the Unit reviewed the 18,830 accounts that carried nominal arrears of some $645 million and relating to the Belize Tax Service Department (that is, the GST, Business Tax and the PAYE levies)."
Of this $645 million: only 6 percent or $38 million were assessed within the last two years; less than 20 percent or $111 million are less than 5 years in arrears; approximately $419 million or 67 percent are noncollectable by law due to the statute of limitations or because they related to the now obsolete Sales Tax;
"Moreover, the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department experts have advised based on the US’s IRS guidance that arrears beyond three years are deemed non collectable.  Nonetheless, the TRU will pursue with vigor the collection of the remaining arrears not deemed uncollectible by law."
"In addition, preliminary estimates indicate that some $334 million relating to 328,721 land accounts are outstanding. Responsibility for these accounts is in the process of being assigned to the Tax Recovery Unit. Determining what proportion of this estimate is actually collectible is a process well underway."
"The Unit’s tactics will include publishing the names of defaulters, triggering court proceedings, and activating lien and all other actions provided for by the Tax Administration and Procedure Act."
"The Ministry of Finance, supported by the Cabinet, is unreservedly committed to the collection of every penny legitimately owing to the Government, which is to say owing to the people of Belize."
I have directed that the Tax Recovery Unit provide periodic public updates as it pursues its important assignment.
The Wage Reinstatement
"Madam Speaker,"
"Following a special Cabinet Working Session from February 24-26, I announced the policy decision to restore the 10 percent wage adjustment, which had become effective July 01 of last year. Wages will therefore be restored 2 years ahead of schedule. When I announced the adjustment in last year’s Budget, I committed that it will not last one day longer than absolutely necessary. The Cabinet and I are keeping that commitment."
"The decision to restore, in dollar terms, translates into an additional $40 million in the Personal Emoluments and $15 million in the Subsidies and Transfer line, for a total of $55 million."
"Increments, as previously programmed, are projected for reinstatement in Fiscal Year 2024/25, contingent on the fiscal circumstances."
"This year, $101 million is being allocated for pension payments."
"Taken all together, wages and pensions, including the wage-related subsidies categorized as Subsidies and Transfers, will total some $704 million."
"Let me repeat, for necessary emphasis that stunning figure: Wages, wage-related subsidies and pensions will cost Government $704 million in the coming Budget year."
62 cents of every dollar Government collects in recurrent revenues will therefore be spent on wages and pensions.
"Using the new Budget estimates, if you account for the additional $384 million required to fund Goods & Services, Debt servicing and the non-wage component of Subsidies and Transfers, what remains for capital investments is $134 million, or 11 cents of every dollar collected."
Belize cannot fund its capital investment needs on this meagre level of capital spending.
"Not with a dispersed population of 433,000 citizens, spread over two cities, seven towns and 200 villages. Not with a commitment for the State to provide adequate health care, a quality education, border and citizen security, a national network of roads and bridges that foster efficient economic growth, to mention just a sampling of the many purposes to be served by a national budget."
"Here are some stark facts: when the previous Administration took office in 2008, the wage bill was $234 million. When we returned to office in 2020, that obligation was an astonishing $577 million, an increase of $343 million or 150 percent. In 2008, pension spending was $38 million. Now it’s $100 million."
Neither revenue growth nor GDP growth kept pace with wage and pension growth. Not even close. So how did the previous Administration fund this bloated wage and pension bill?
"Well, they spent money they did not have, and they borrowed, effectively to pay wages and pensions; borrowing was at a pace of $1 million per day when we took office. It is that record of reckless borrowing and spending that enfeebled the public finances and the economy so that when COVID-19 hit us, the country was brought to the brink of default and devaluation."
"To ensure medium-term stability, and in the context of the wage restoration, I wish to make these policy positions clear:"
"First, national prosperity can only be achieved if the public service   those to whom $704 million will accrue in 2022   carry out their functions effectively, which includes revenue collection. My Administration seeks an empowered, well-informed, well-trained and equipped, motivated public service as the partner of and implementer for Executive policies. There is no other proven governance recipe for national success."
"Second, Government retains a sacred obligation to all Belizeans to administer the National Budget in a manner that’s fair, that serves the national interest, that fosters justice, equality, and prosperity."
"Third, enhanced revenue collection as well as spending reform are non-negotiable priorities of this Administration. So, for example, the Tax Recovery Unit is empowered to collect what is legally due to Government, nothing more nothing less. And in the case of Public Pensions, a restructuring of the non-contributory framework is a national emergency. The strength of the public finances, a central pillar upon which the State fulfills its Constitutional obligations, will not be put at risk for a pension program which is patently unsustainable."
"I, therefore, invite the Public Service Union and all stakeholders to join in a spirit of mutual interest so that this high priority issue can be properly evaluated and a new framework formalized during this fiscal year. That is Government’s firm and necessary timeline."
"I make one final point: Cabinet is, without exception, aware of and grateful for the thousands of exemplary public officers whose competence and initiative represent the highest ideal of service. These men and women of integrity and grit plow at all levels, in all Ministries, in Government and quasi-government departments and institutions."
"I offer them our respect and gratitude, and most importantly, an assurance that we will continue to manage the public finances in a manner that makes the stability and sustainability of your job our foremost objective."

Structural and Technical Reform
"Madam Speaker,"
"This Government is transforming the way it does the people’s business. Never before, in such a short period of time, have structural reforms been embraced with such enthusiasm and efficiency. And much of the focus is on the critical functions and processes of public finance management."
"First is the introduction of active cash/money management of government’s finances to minimize interest expenses and finance charges.  Recall that when we took office, the Government was borrowing almost $1 million per day.  This led to habitual almost addictive recourse to issuance of treasury securities and a ballooning of Government’s overdraft with the Central Bank of over $90 million.  In less than one year, this overdraft balance has been entirely eliminated under my administration without increasing the issue of domestic debt securities."
"Second is the introduction of market-based yield curve management of government-issued securities.  In the history of Belize, successive governments arbitrarily determined interest rates on treasury securities to its detriment.  The effect was that the government paid tens of millions more in interest expense than it should have paid.  It also meant that by such above-market yields on its benchmark government securities, government was contributing to higher interest rates in the financial system.  My administration is bringing that to an end in a phased manner through market-based yield curve management effective January 1, 2022.  This is already materially reducing the interest expense of government that will yield millions in savings but will also create a downward pressure on interest rates in the financial system."
"Third, is the comprehensive Public Finance Management Reform Program evidenced and supported by the recent Loan Motion authorized by the National Assembly for Government to access funding from the IDB in the sum of US$8.0 million."
This funding will support a Program consisting of four sub-component objectives which aim at strengthening public financial management: (i) improve the efficiency of key expenditure functions; (ii) promote economies of scale and competitiveness among suppliers in the procurement of all goods and services; (iii) promote a more sustainable technological infrastructure enabling processes to be more reliable and faster; (iv) improve institutional capacity for personnel to carry out processes and operate systems efficiently.
"Work in these areas has already commenced.  A draft centralized public procurement Bill is in its final stages, with assistance from the IDB, while an Internal Audit Bill is being finalized as well.  The former Bill will make provisions with respect to public procurement and for the retention and disposal of public property in accordance with the principles of good governance, accountability, transparency, integrity, fair competition, and value for money. It will largely align with the CARICOM model procurement law but go further. It will establish a Central Procurement Unit, a Procurement Board, and a Procurement Review Commission."
"Fourth is the Public Financial Management Support Programme, funded by the EU under the 11th EDF, which provides long term technical assistance in achieving a Public Finance Management Reform Action Plan with clear objectives linked to improving the PFM legal framework, specifically in internal and external audit and the Contractor General, as well as strengthening PFM oversight and control functions.  Under this Programme, the capacity of the Auditor General’s Department and the Contractor General’s Office has been strengthened with improved working procedures, strategic planning and capacity building actions through extensive guidance, collaboration, training and development of relevant documentation; an Internal Audit Unit in the Ministry of Finance was created and the legal framework to support the work of the new unit is being developed; a large number of public officers are to be trained in the areas of audit, financial procedures, training techniques, among others; and new computer equipment was handed over to these departments, including the Accountant General’s Department, to better equip these key departments to effectively carry out their mandates."
Fifth is the pursuit of a Fiscal Balance Sheet approach to public sector finance.
"The Government, in a phased manner and over the medium term, aims to develop full and comprehensive fiscal financial statements including a Fiscal balance sheet and a government asset inventory."
This will be done through the implementation of Accrual Basis accounting in accordance with INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC SECTOR ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (IPSAS).
"The aim is for Belize to have a comprehensive Balance Sheet that both captures the government asset inventory of financial and non-financial assets and shows the financial net worth of the country, a Statement of Cashflows that shows the cash receipts and payments for Government’s operations, investing activities and financing activities and an Income Statement that shows the annual performance of revenues and expenses for the year."
"Over time Belize will be on a path to ensure sustainability in the face of challenges like climate change, pandemics, geopolitical shocks. Belize will be able to responsibly create and manage fiscal space required to implement Plan Belize and the reforms required to improve the quality of life for all Belizeans. Most of all this will be done in a transparent and accountable way that is likely to prevent any future undermining of value that Belize has suffered due to fiscal imprudence and will create the atmosphere of confidence required to encourage investment and attract resources on better terms."
"In this regard, Madam Speaker, Belize has approached our IFI partners for Technical Assistance and the response has been positive. We expect to commence work on this program in the upcoming fiscal year."
"Madam Speaker, we intend to table this proposed legislation in this upcoming fiscal year for House consideration and approval as we strive to modernize our public financial management systems and bring greater efficiency and accountability in the management of our public finances."
"These structural reforms are not exhaustive by any means: two other examples stand out. First, the work of the Wages Council, from which I expect the minimum wage adjustment to be implemented during this fiscal year. And second, the People’s Constitutional Commission whose core task will be to propose ways of enhancing our democratic processes and deepening citizen participation in the governance of our communities."
Extraordinary Financing
"Madam Speaker,"
"I am pleased to confirm that Belize is one of only two countries chosen by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), an independent United States Government foreign aid agency, to give support to micro, small, and medium enterprises in its effort to reduce poverty through growth. The compact and threshold programs, which will be signed between the Government of Belize and MCC could result in Belize gaining between $300 million and $1 billion in grant funding to aid in the nation’s economic development."
"Belize was chosen by the MCC Board having satisfied themselves that the current administration is committed to governing justly, investing in the development of our people and its economic policy."
The MCC-funded projects are expected to commence in 2023 and last for a period of five years. MCC awards countries based on the principle that aid is most effective when it is reinforced by good governance.
"Madam Speaker, my Government is actively pursuing this initiative and has established a small dedicated unit in the Office of the Prime Minister to implement this program."
"I wish to take this opportunity to publicly acknowledge and thank the Government and people of the United States of America for this support and for this apparent vote of confidence in my Government and by extension, the people of Belize."
"In addition to the MCC Coordination Unit, we have set up the first-ever Climate Finance Unit in the Ministry of Economic Development to actively pursue grant funding from the specialized climate funds, primarily the Green Climate Fund (GCF)."
"The Unit has hit the ground running and in the space of less than one year, has been successful in obtaining pre-accreditation support from the GCF to facilitate both the Belize Social Investment Fund and the Ministry of Economic Development itself to become fully accredited members of the Fund and in doing so bridge the gap in services provided by national accredited entities.  It has also been successful in reviving tens of millions of dollars in concessionary and grant funding from IFAD and GCF under the Resilient Rural Belize Program for climate-smart agriculture and rural infrastructure, funds that were almost entirely lost due to lax behaviour and avoidable delays in implementation by the past UDP administration."
Government is also engaged with the GCF to facilitate the direct access of the private sector through collaboration with the Caribbean Development Bank as the Delivery Partner and Belize’s Chamber of Commerce and Industry as the lead Executing Entity. And efforts are underway to provide technical support to strengthen the operational policies of the Development Finance Corporation to enable it to comply with GCF accreditation requirements and therefore gain direct access to GCF financing.
"And finally, the Office of the Prime Minister has also activated a special desk to coordinate our commitments and capitalize on opportunities related to the Financing for Marine Conservation Program, the Blue Bonds. $168 million over 20 years will flow to the Conservation Trust under this agreement, at least 40 percent of which can be directed at financing public sector marine conservation. This Special Desk will also serve as the focal point for our exciting, high-potential new collaboration with the World Wildlife Fund called the Project Finance Permanence."
"With a high degree of confidence, I predict that Belize will benefit from massive new grant flows when all these various programs get into gear."

ACCELERATED FUNDING FROM THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA ON TAIWAN
"Madam Speaker,"
"I am pleased to inform this House and the Belizean people that our Mission to Taiwan last week secured extraordinary gains for this Budget and for the economy. Last year, as you will recall, Belize and Taiwan agreed to a 5-year program of grant and concessionary loan funding that totaled US 105m.  So far, and including this Budget for Fiscal Year 2022/23, Government will have drawn down US$15m in grants and US$42m in soft loans. Taiwan has now agreed that in this Fiscal Year, Belize can proceed to apply for the entire remainder USD 48m under this Agreement, in effect, converting a 5-year program to a 2-year program. In principle, the focal areas for investing these additional funds will be in education   expanding the Healthy Start Feeding Program and eventually, the Digital Devices Program; in Housing   expanding our current target for distributing quality, low cost housing units countrywide; and in financing SME credit, especially low interest loans in the Agro-productive sector."
"In the coming months, I will table a supplementary appropriations bill that will confirm each Program along with its funding amounts, for consideration and approval."
"And there is more exceptional news: I am elated to formally announce a USD 16.8m grant from Taiwan for the design and construction of a new hospital for Ambergris Caye, that hospital to commence construction in this fiscal year. The new hospital will be a 45-bed, 28,000 square feet state of the art facility providing primary and secondary care services. Others before us made hollow promises to build this much-needed facility.  It is this PUP Government that will finally deliver for the people of Ambergris Caye and of Belize Rural South."
Medium-Term Budget Forecast
"Madam Speaker,"
"Our Finance Team has included in the Budget a medium-term, 4-year forecast, with targets through to Fiscal Year 26/27."
"We envision revenues growing in the early years by 3 to 4 percent and levelling off at 2 percent growth in the outer years of the forecast period. Our goal is to hold firm on spending limits, at least for the short term, with expenditures rising by 2 to 3 percent starting in FY 25/26."
"To stabilize the public finances, a primary surplus of at least 2 percent of GDP is the bare minimum necessary. This is the goal identified in these projections, mainly because of restoring wages and withholding new revenue adjustments."
"Overall net financing for the 5-year period, including the new Budget, will be some $243 million; that is, the difference between required Budget financing and amortization payments. On the basis that GDP growth will exceed this new debt, the country’s debt to GDP will fall over the medium term."
I would also emphasize that Government expects capital investments   the combination of Capital II and III financing   to total $1.42 billion over this 5-year period.
Conclusion
"Madam Speaker,"
"The journey of sound public finance management is a constant, never-ending endeavor."
"No matter how much progress is made in one budget period, risks arise in another that can quickly undo that progress."
"In just the last few weeks, war has erupted in Eastern Europe. The unimaginable specter of oil at over US$200 per barrel presents a real and present danger to the Belizean economy and public finances."
"At US$200 per barrel, the cost of fuel imports could more than double to over Belize $30 million dollars per month, representing a massive drain on foreign exchange and, at some point, a substantial loss of revenue."
"Rising oil prices will worsen the recessionary risks, and clearly, inflationary pressures, such pressures escalating even before the Russian invasion of the Ukraine. This is an urgent situation about which I intend to consult later this week with our social partners and key sectoral representatives."
"Covid-19, another prominent risk, has receded in recent weeks but the scientists have certainly not ruled out the possibility of a new variant which could disrupt the delicate recovery of the travel and tourism sectors. When compared to 2019, Belize’s 2021 economic rebound entailed only a 46 percent recovery in overnight tourism arrivals and an 18 percent recovery in cruise arrivals. In other words, for our most vital economic subsector, 2021’s bounce-back represented only a partial recovery."
"In addition to these external variables, there is the urgent need for the Budget to permanently balance the mix between recurrent and capital spending. In this fiscal year, as I highlighted before, 85 cents of every recurrent dollar in revenue will be spent on recurrent expenditure, the largest component of which is Government’s wage and pension obligations."
"With pride and purpose, we have proposed this Fiscal Year 22/23 construct to allow time for the economic recovery to solidify and for wage relief to offset rising inflation."
This posture must evolve as the circumstances evolve.
"For sustainability, I emphasize, revenue buoyancy must continue, and recurrent spending must remain within strict limits, if we are to avoid subsequent adjustments to both tax revenue and recurrent spending."
"Despite these broad cautions, my colleagues and I carry ever more optimism about the future of our young nation. As businesses and schools accelerate their re-opening, with public wages restored and private minimum wages soon to be raised, as Government’s capital investments converge on bridging the welfare and opportunity gaps, with trade and investment policies reaping increased dividends, I eagerly anticipate a multi-year economic expansion, with the thousands of new jobs and hundreds of new enterprises envisioned in our Manifesto."
"That every Belizean should win, and in that glorious sum of collective betterment, for our precious Jewel to shine ever brighter among nations, this shall remain our Administration’s clarion call."
"When I presented my Government’s first Budget last year, I proposed a 5-Point Recovery Plan. Despite the doubt of the then leader of the opposition who said it could not and would not be done, every single one of these points have been effectively addressed during this year:"
* Our Budget pared wages and kept spending within projected parameters;
* A historic debt restructuring eliminated half a billion in public debt;
* Revenues over-performed allowing us the flexibility to table supplementary investments during the financial year;
"* Every major investment-climate indicator has improved: the trade balance narrowed, the current account balance was the smallest in years, bank capital and liquidity are ample, lending rates are down and reserves up, while the official and private sector are more enthused about Belize than in recent memory."
* And Pension Reform is programmed for this year.
"These are the unmistakable measures of progress, the bellwethers of even greater, more inclusive expansion and prosperity."
"If Belize is to grow and develop, all of us must be committed to a strong Belizean economy and society, grounded in credible, practical plans and solutions to the social and economic challenges we face."
With hands and hearts joined together in this great experiment we move forward to build a nation of prosperous citizens.  To live out those fundamental principles enshrined in our Constitution and we remain dedicated to the enhancement of a nation people who not only believe but remain committed to social economic and environmental justice.
"I thank my Parliamentary colleagues, the technicians at the line Ministries and the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank, and the many professions involved with the preparation of this National Budget for Fiscal Year 2022/23."
I commend this Appropriations Bill for the House’s consideration.
Thank you.


"February 28, 2022"
"Greetings from San Pedro where the Summit is about to start, but I have taken time out to report to you on Cabinet’s first retreat which we held last week."
"My ministers and I held in-depth discussions on the draft budget for fiscal year 2022   2023. We reviewed the IMF’s concluding statement issued at the end of its recent Article IV consultation. While the IMF hailed our impressive economic performance, they cautioned that economically we are not out of the woods yet. Therefore, the Cabinet approved a budget that is prudent and pragmatic. We will emphasize an ambitious social policy agenda which centres on bringing relief to the more vulnerable among us, expanding the NHI program while continuing to rebuild the Belizean economy in partnership with the private sector, the Unions, and non-governmental actors."
"We received a detailed report from the Ministerial Team which met with the joint unions. Significant progress was made in those discussion towards finding a path to restoring benefits for public officers and teachers. After careful deliberation, Cabinet has settled our position on these matters, and we will inform the Unions of the elements of that position which includes much needed pension reform. More importantly, we believe we have found a workable compromise which includes restoring the full 10 percent to public officers and teachers."
"On COVID-19, the Cabinet has decided that it is time to re-balance responsibility in the fight against COVID-19. For some two years, the Government has responded to the pandemic by embarking on a massive public health campaign, securing hundreds of thousands of vaccines, heavily imposing restrictions on personal freedoms and curtailing social and economic activities. The Cabinet has decided that the time has come to restore personal and economic freedoms, while encouraging everyone to act responsibly."
"Effective 1st March the curfew will be lifted. The Minister of Health will provide more details of the process by which we will lift all measures during the month of March as we move towards normalcy on 1st April 2022. We continue to urge Belizeans to get vaccinated and for those who have not yet been boosted, we urge you to do so."
"My Cabinet recognizes that there is a pressing need to address social issues such as the rising cost-of-living increases. While price increases are due largely to external factors, we believe that there are steps that can be taken by government to ease the hardship. We are actively reviewing the basket of goods on which tax relief can be granted, will vigorously increase enforcement of price controls, and adopt measures to curb price gouging."
"Another important issue discussed during the Cabinet Retreat was governance. In this regard there was a strong sense that constitutional reform is needed to strengthen democracy in Belize. The Constitution is designed around a dominant Cabinet, and two main political parties. These structures, which were designed in the previous century, must be reviewed and reformed to meet the needs of a more democratic Belize. To this end, a People’s Constitutional Commission will be appointed to undertake this major task of constitutional reform and is expected to complete its work in 15 months."
"Since taking office we have done what was necessary to rescue Belize from financial disaster, protected Belizeans from the COVID-19 pandemic and, we started to implement our social justice agenda set out in Plan Belize. We will continue the work and press on with delivering on our promise to build a nation where everybody wins."
I thank you.


His Excellency Joseph Biden   President of the United States of America
Heads of State and Government
Distinguished Representatives
Ladies and Gentlemen

We have gathered in the City of Angels.
The American city that most reflects the best and worst of the Americas.
A city that is home to millions of citizens from every country in the western hemisphere.
A melting pot.
A melange.
Un crisol de culturas
"A city in which too many have too much, and too many have too little."
A mirror of the Americas in 2022.
"Los Angeles — a beautiful city endowed with abundant riches, where ambition coupled with hard work makes real the promise of the American dream   that a decent living is possible for the majority."
"My friends we have come to this blessed place to refresh our collective will to do good, and to once again recommit ourselves to building a socially just Americas. From Barrow, Alaska in the north to Tierra del Fuego in the south, the peoples of the Americas await the outcome of this 9th Summit of the Americas. Their needs are many. Their hopes expectant. While our philosophies and approaches are divergent, our vision is the same: to build an Americas that works for all of us."
"But, we are at a tipping point. The Americas and the world face existential threats.  As leaders, we are called to make consequential choices which will irreversibly shape our collective future."
"Excellencies, will we continue to postpone the urgent action needed to reduce emissions, finance adaptation and mitigation and protect the most vulnerable countries and populations from the impact of climate change? We cannot."
Will we implement practical and innovative measures to alleviate the crushing debt crisis? We must.
"Will we ensure that the socioeconomic devastation including the sharp rise in poverty, hunger and education loss caused by the pandemic do not result in a lost decade for the Americas with more irregular migration and insecurity?  We can."
Will we allow ourselves to be divided by failed cold war paradigms or will be meet the profound challenges united and with common purpose? We will.
"These are the questions which underpin the theme of this Ninth Summit of the Americas: “Building a Sustainable, Resilient, and Equitable Future”. How we respond to these questions will design our destiny."
"As we seek solutions we know that money is not the problem. For example, in less than three months two countries in this hemisphere committed over $55 billion to Ukraine. The question is: how much will be pledged to finance the ambitious agendas we agree at this Summit?"
"The future of the Western Hemisphere is a responsibility of all the countries of this hemisphere. Irrespective of our size, or GDP, or our system of governance, we all have a shared interest in a sustainable, resilient and equitable future."
The power of the Summit of the Americas is the space it provides for all the countries of the Americas to dialogue and agree on joint actions. The Summit belongs to all of the Americas.
"It is therefore inexcusable that all countries of the Americas are not here, and the power of the Summit diminished by their absence. It is incomprehensible that we would isolate countries of the Americas which have provided strong leadership and contributed to the hemisphere on the critical issues of our time."
"Cuba has provided consistent, unmatched cooperation in health to almost two-thirds of the countries in this hemisphere including Belize. Cuban healthcare experts of the Henry Reeve Brigade were on the frontline in the very early and uncertain days of Belize’s COVID-19 response. Many Belizean doctors and healthcare professionals are trained in Cuba. The illegal blockade against Cuba is an affront to humanity. It continues to cause untold suffering. It is inconsistent with our values. In fact, it is unamerican."
"The time has come, Mr. President, to lift the blockade and to build bonds of friendship with the people of Cuba. Similarly, Venezuela has done so much toward energy security for the Caribbean region through its innovative financing programmes. Venezuela’s absence is unforgivable."
"Excellencies, at this most critical juncture when the future of our hemisphere is at stake, we stand divided. And that is why this Summit of the Americas should have been inclusive. Belize rejects the unilateral right of any country to impose exclusions. We assert, unequivocally, that the principle of inclusivity must be the touchstone of all future summits. Geography, not politics, defines the Americas."
"The Belizean people, like people across Latin America and the Caribbean, are weathering successive and simultaneous crises. Caribbean economies are in a precarious place because of our inherent vulnerabilities to external shocks, including exposure to climate change and devastating storms. But the pandemic and now the effects because of the war in Ukraine have further battered our economies."
"Notwithstanding the 6% recovery in global growth in 2021, CARICOM Member States, except for Guyana, recorded an average growth rate of 1 percent. A few Member States experienced even further GDP losses ranging from -1% to -6.3%. Member States were expected to record a stronger growth performance in 2022.  But the effects of the war, rising inflation, rising oil costs and further supply chain disruptions have led the IMF to downgrade growth projection for the region. We cannot continue on this path."
"This regression was not of our making. We are ready to join our partners in the Americas to design measures that will provide urgent and targeted responses to arrest this decline. We have come to Los Angeles to agree specific deliverables on climate change, debt relief, access to concessionary financing, energy and food security. With firm commitments we can move forward."
"Now is the time for actions that are focused on achieving a sustainable, resilient and equitable future for the hemisphere. Action must include equitable access to vaccines and treatment for COVID-19 to end the acute phase of the pandemic and a strengthened and sustainably financed global health architecture. Action must include the Paris 2030 delivery agenda. We demand firm plans from developed countries for emissions reduction targets in line with the 1.5 degree centigrade Paris temperature goal, a plan to scale up climate finance beyond the floor of the US100 billion dollars annually through to 2025, and doubling of adaptation finance."
"Action must include finalization and use of a multidimensional vulnerability index to determine access to grants and concessional development finance, so that countries like ours can affordably finance our recovery and build resiliently. Action must include debt relief."
"Action must include a coordinated, multilateral response to the deepening food and energy crises including financing and technology transfer to support the acceleration to renewable energy."
Action must include finding peace in the Ukraine.
"Today Belize affirma the integral role of democratic governance. Let there be no doubt about our unshakeable commitment thereto. The confluence of crises of our times requires all the countries of the hemisphere to work together in a spirit of solidarity and cooperation. As we work at this Ninth Summit of the Americas, lets us call to mind the words of El Libertador, Simon Bolivar: “En la unidad de nuestras naciones descansa el glorioso futuro de nuestros pueblos”"
“In the unity of our nations rests the glorious future of our peoples.”
Thank you.


"Brussels, Belgium"
"June 21, 2022"
"Her Excellency Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission"
Colleague Heads of State and Government
Distinguished Representatives
Ladies and Gentlemen
"After two years of virtual meetings, it is really great to be physically present to discuss some of the most pressing challenges before us as leaders of nations large and small alike."
We meet in beautiful Brussels at a decisive moment.
"Not only is the world in the recovery stages of the global pandemic, but we are also witnessing a catastrophic invasion by Russia of Ukraine whose impact has spread far beyond their borders, indeed far beyond this continent."
"These shocks have sparked a domino effect of economic uncertainty and social distress, which has compounded the existing vulnerabilities that have plagued Caribbean nations like my own for years."
"Today our small nations in the Caribbean, including Belize, are grappling with high inflation rates, unsustainable debt, increasing poverty, food and energy insecurity and climate change among other major external factors hindering the development of our nations."
"For example, in Belize, when my administration took office in November 2020, Belize’s debt-to-GDP ratio stood at an alarming 133 percent, unemployment stood at 30 percent, and the poverty rate was estimated at about 60 percent."
"Immediately, my government proceeded with our multi-year recovery and transformational framework called Plan Belize."
"This set the foundation for our Medium-Term Development Strategy, which allows us to re-establish macroeconomic order and stimulate investments in several key sectors over the next five years."
Plan Belize has already started to bear good fruit.
"Last November, we successfully converted an unsustainable private debt by paying it off and converting it into a Blue Bond that will assist us with our marine conservation efforts while helping us to achieve debt sustainability."
"This transaction alone decreased the debt to GDP ratio by an estimated 12 percent, set aside almost four million dollars annually for marine conservation and set up a Marine Conservation Trust Fund that will be worth almost one hundred million dollars by 2040."
"Belize, like other Caribbean nations, will continue to value relationships with our development partners like the European Union, and its member states, who have been some of our closest and most committed partners."
"Historically, we have used EU funds to improve the livelihoods of the Belizean people through three main instruments: the European Development Fund, Accompanying Measures for Sugar and the Accompanying Banana."
"Now, we are turning a new page in our development partnership under the EU’s NDICI-Global Europe Instrument."
"The EU’s contribution has helped with meaningful rural transformation through the development of small and micro-enterprise infrastructure, through major investments that have driven our competitiveness on international markets and in the area of renewable energy ─ all initiatives that are helping us improve productivity and reducing poverty."
"Across the Caribbean, commitments by the EU have assisted our governments with Green Growth and Sustainable socio-economic development, along with our efforts to enhance good governance and improve regional integration."
"Allow me a minute to express on behalf of the people of Belize and our neighbour Guatemala, our sincere appreciation to the EU for its efforts at regional peace and security."
Your contribution to the Culture of Peace program and in our efforts to find a peaceful and lasting resolution to the Guatemalan unfounded territorial claim to Belizean territory is invaluable and continues to be important.
"Like you, we desire to live in peace; for this reason, we strongly condemn what is currently occurring in Ukraine."
We applaud measures by the EU to bolster their support to the Ukrainian people.
"Excellencies, Belize, like the rest of the Caribbean, is working towards meaningful sustainable development and the economic transformation of our people."
"To this end, we will continue mobilizing resources and expertise that will help with the advancement of our people."
We look forward to the support and engagement of our EU counterparts especially as we seek to address global Inflation.
But any talk of the future would be deficient without addressing the very real threat that persists at this very moment.
"To truly embody the forum’s Global Gateway strategy, we need to address global inflation and condemn the geopolitical tensions that threaten to diminish global connectivity and the investments we have made in driving innovation."
"As we come together at this 15th European Development Days Forum, let us ensure that our dialogue is fruitful, our outcomes effective and our alliances enduring."
"The people we represent and the global community of which we are all a part, are counting on us to turn our words into action."


"My fellow Belizeans,"
"We gather on this hallowed Independence Hill, in front of Parliament, in the capital City of the sovereign state of Belize, to mark the 41st birthday of our beloved nation."
"I am privileged, for a second year now, to acknowledge the presence of so many distinguished guests and friends of Belize, and to offer my heartfelt congratulations to the citizens and residents of our Jewel, our blessed land."
This year we celebrate our independence in a time of global upheaval.
There is unthinkable conflict in Eastern Europe with talk of nuclear weapons.
"In Asia, our close ally, the Republic of China on Taiwan, is menaced constantly by the military threats of its mammoth neighbor."
"In Latin America, democratic principles are stressed by the lure of autocracy in addressing injustice, while the passing of Queen Elizabeth II in the United Kingdom will force a rethink of constitutional tradition in Belize, the Caribbean and African Commonwealth."
"And of course, even as the Covid pandemic and its massive ramifications recede, the demon of high inflation has been let loose upon the global economy."
This demon devours the purchasing power of the poorest people.
It raises the cost of financing to a point that sovereign debt burdens stand at historical highs.
"And rising interest rates, according to World Bank President David Malpass, will inevitably precipitate a punitive global recession, and possibly stagflation, starting in 2023."
"Apart from these unprecedented threats to people’s economic welfare and to participatory democracy, the climate crisis is wreaking havoc in every corner of our planet."
Today our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Mexico and of Taiwan where two separate earthquakes caused the loss of life and limb and billions in loss and damage.
"As we enter the active period of the Atlantic hurricane season, we in the Caribbean have to deal with the annual shocks caused by ever increasing violent storms."
An IMF assessment showed that two thirds of the 511 disasters to hit small countries since 1950 have occurred in Caribbean countries.
"Whether wildfires and droughts in North America, monsoons and flooding in Asia, deforestation in Latin America or crop failure in Africa, the world is unarguably less hospitable to humanity today than anytime in living memory."
"Looking in the mirror at 41 and considering the current state of our nation, I believe that this backdrop of apparent worldwide upheaval gives all of us here in Belize plenty of reasons to be simultaneously proud, confident and resolute."
Belizeans can be proud that our Constitution is unblemished in 41 years.
"Six times since Independence, there has been an orderly transition of political power, without violence or even the threat of violence."
"Just two weeks ago, a new Chief Justice was sworn in and she will oversee an entirely independent Judiciary, free of political control or interference."
"The Belizean public square, buttressed by myriad freedoms, and a vibrant, independent press corps, is more lively and more animated than ever."
"In just the last few months, two unrelated national petitions have attracted tens of thousands of individual signatures."
This is but one example of Belizean democracy in action.
These are ample reasons for national pride and national confidence.
All of this is in partial fulfillment of Plan Belize.
Equally significant is the fact that Belize’s fiscal and economic health have proven spectacularly resilient.
"This year’s National Budget, with a neutral primary balance, will see total spending of 29 percent of GDP."
"Thirty point five percent of total spending will flow to the human development pillars of education, health and community welfare."
"The public debt, at 132 percent of GDP two years ago, has been slashed to 90 percent of GDP, by a combination of debt restructuring, GDP growth, spending restraint and a revaluation of economic productivity."
"This year, in fact, interest on the public debt will represent seven cents of every dollar spent by Government."
"Our resiliency is home-grown, not IFI-imposed."
"When we look in the mirror at 41, Belizeans should see a country on the cusp of being able to feed itself, a goal so many of our peers yearned to attain at the peak of the Covid pandemic."
Domestic production of various food staples has reached truly impressive levels.
For example:
In 2021 rice production was over 33 million pounds
beans was over 20 million pounds
corn was over 215 million pounds
chicken was over 42 million pounds.
over five million dozen eggs
16.5 million pounds of milk
the national cattle herd stood at 170 thousand heads of cattle
"and in Citrus, it has been announced that our growers are getting the highest payment in more than 15 years. Citrus farmers are once again replanting their groves and Government has set aside $15 Million for this purpose."
"With an estimated 1,280 acres of vegetable production, Belize is almost self-sufficient in this important measure."
"And this agricultural productivity is derived from farmers large and small alike   14,307 of them, harvesting more than 613,000 acres across this country."
The prospect of national food self-sufficiency has not compromised our sacred pact with nature.
"A third or more of our land and our seas are protected sanctuaries, immense stores of wealth safeguarded for the benefit of our children and for their children."
Our recent debt for conservation exchange is now serving as a global model for debt relief and environmental reform.
"These are, at 41, immeasurable sources of national pride and confidence."
"It is not without irony, I believe, that half a century after the Father of our Nation George Price cautioned us about the risks of unchecked capitalism and unrestrained markets, his caution is being vindicated on a much wider stage than Belize."
So-called developed countries have reconsidered what development truly entails if that development is to be sustainable beyond this year’s profit and beyond this generation.
"The social justice of George Price’s “mixed economy,” radical thinking in the Cold War setting, now seems like common sense when we witness the European Union capping the profits of energy firms or the United Kingdom placing a ceiling on household energy bills."
"Whether in the case of constant financial support starting with capping the cost of fuel by reducing fuel taxes, subsidies for our cane farmers, further subsidies for our bus companies, tour operators and bakers, Belize can be proud that our public policy makes creative accommodations for the common good, notwithstanding external pressures."
"Of course, a nation’s life, its evolution, does not end at 41, and pride and confidence must, as I said earlier, be matched with resolve to address those facets of national development that remain unconquered."
"And it is this requisite resolve that has led to the launch of the People’s Constitution Commission, whose work shall commence shortly, to consult far and wide and to recommend constitutional changes that will enhance national unity and upliftment as well as good governance."
"It is our resolve to peacefully secure every square inch of territory, land and sea that led us, upon approval in a referendum, to the ICJ for final determination of any claim to Belize by Guatemala."
"We are also resolute in rolling back the plague of poverty, so that every Belizean can enjoy the many bounties of our homeland."
THIS IS WHY IN JANUARY THE $5 PER HOUR MINIMUM WAGE WILL BE  IMPLEMENTED.
It is why the introduction of free secondary school education has begun at four major high schools on the Southside of Belize City and will eventually be rolled out countrywide.
It is why we continue to hand over the keys to new starter homes heavily subsidized by your government to needy Belizeans in every corner of Belize.
And it is why job creation sits at the apex of importance within Government’s investment policy framework.
"That framework is off to a magnificent start, with 332 million dollars of new foreign direct investment anticipated in 2022, principally in the areas of tourism, agriculture, agro-processing and in the BPO sector."
And it is why thousands of hard-working Belizeans are benefitting from new land grants or the regularization of land titles that have been outstanding for far too long.
"Granting land to the needy is a unique transfer of wealth, and one that we are devoted to expanding."
"On the heels of last year’s historic investment conference, this year, Government is spearheading the first ever MSME Road Show, to bring the enabling tools for small business to every major district and community in our country."
Today there is more than 400 million dollars in the banking sector in excess liquidity.
"The Belize Enterprise Revolving Fund (BERF) will diversify the national economy by strengthening and improving MSME competitiveness, through financing and technical assistance."
"There is the earmarking of MSME loans, of which 60 percent is to be designated for women."
The MSME Enhancement Program (MEP) seeks to strengthen the competitiveness of Belize’s MSME Sector by fostering exports via the removal of Custom Import duty for a shortlist of packaging and labelling materials;
making  Legislative changes by establishing a program to grant MSME businesses operating informally a four-year exemption from Business Tax and GST after registering with the Belize Tax Services and BELTRAIDE.
The Government will also award 20 percent of its procurement tenders by 2025 to MSMEs.
"The total annual purchase of goods and services for the government  is 225 million dollars, 20 percent of this is 45mn dollars."
Registered MSMEs will be able to tap  into this 45 million dollar market.
I am confident that the 16.3 percent growth in GDP in 2021 and the 5.3 percent growth in the first quarter of 2022 is but the start of an extended surge in economic expansion and prosperity.
"Our focus, our insistence, is that this growth be equitable, across districts; focused on job creating industry and export-oriented businesses, to further fortify the Belize dollar."
"At present, our fixed peg is backed by well over four months of import cover."
"We are resolved to transforming the national infrastructure, not with extravagant spending that provides one-time jobs but with targeted, prudent investments that enable product to market transfers and that build intra-community wealth."
"At present, 213.3 miles of paving construction is underway as we expand the Primary Road Network."
"239.8 miles of improved secondary roads is this year’s goal, as town and village connections are prioritized."
"And 11 bridges are under construction, including the 30 million dollars to be invested in a new Haulover Bridge along the Phillip Goldson Highway."
"Recently, I led an official mission to Germany to examine an exciting new process for converting sargassum to clean energy."
How inventive a prospect for the coastline litter of sargassum to be transformed into power.
Any power from sargassum will complement the additional solar power that our PUC soon expects to sanction as part of the national generation system.
"Soon to commence as well, is a phased, 250-million-dollar expansion and remodeling of the Phillip Goldson International Airport to begin along with improvement to several municipal facilities."
"A recent Master Plan for the PGIA envisions 3 million passenger movements by 2040, triple the current level."
"A national Ports Policy will lay out the requirements for urgent improvements to the Belize City Port, complementing recent expansion at the Big Creek Port."
"And, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has committed to linking Northern Belize with the multi-billion-dollar Tren Maya Initiative in Southern Mexico."
"Tourism, the up-market high-end brand, is Belize’s preferred niche and the BTB is resolved to exceed the 2019 overnight arrivals next year, two years ahead of the global trend."
And our resolve to further suppress crime and violence on our streets and in our communities has never been stronger.
A new radar will help in the fight against transnational drug trafficking.
New intakes to the Police and Defense Forces will augment the already elevated cadres of law enforcement officers and expanded training in prevention and prosecution is being funded.
"Pride, confidence, resolve."
"This is our mantra at 41, writ large and bold across every Belizean sunrise."
Hoy celebramos la independencia de un pueblo…
un pueblo del cual estoy muy orgulloso de reclamar como: “mi pueblo” Belice.
Un pueblo pequeño que hace cuarenta y un años obtuvo su independencia política pacíficamente…
sin derrame de sangre.
Este gran objetivo se logró con mucha as-tucia diplomática y apoyo internacional.
Y en el año 1981 se logró una identidad para nosotros los beliceños.
"Compatriotas beliceños, como solía decir el Padre de esta gran nación, hoy en el 2022 estamos, como pueblo, logrando lo que es un objetivo muy real y práctico."
Después de la pandemia estamos recuperando y empezamos a lograr lo que llamamos la independencia económica.
"La libertad económica, que hoy es lo que cuenta y es de suma importancia para la sobrevivencia y dignidad de nuestro pueblo."
"Para nuestros conciudadanos, poder trabajar o poder ganarse la vida en su propia empresa, por muy pequeña que sea, es un sueño y una aspiración general."
Es por lo que este gobierno ha tomado la responsabilidad de crear un entorno…un ecosistema propicio.
En los dos últimos años es exactamente lo que hemos estado haciendo y hoy podemos declarar que el plan esta funcionando.
Con nuestro PlanBelice se le está creando la oportunidad a todo beliceño para poder trabajar de un modo u otro.
Con esto se está logrando la independencia real de nuestra población.
"En 1981 George Price, el padre de la patria nos brindó la independencia política."
Hoy perseguimos la independencia económica que el tanto anhelaba para todo beliceño.
"Esto, paisanos míos, me hace retomar los pensamientos del Apóstol de la independencia de Cuba, el célebre Jose Martí,que dijo que “La Felicidad general de un pueblo descansa en la independencia individual de sus habitantes” y que “una nación libre es el resultado de sus pobladores libres”."
"And so, to every Belizean student, from kinder to university,"
"To every Belizean worker, from the public officer to office staff to those in the fields,"
"To every Belizean homemaker and retiree,"
"To our entrepreneurs and artists,"
I salute you today.
This happy birthday is your collective achievement.
This is your day.
"By your pride, your confidence, your resolve, you show the world that small is special, that undeveloped is rich and that third world is first rate."
"And so with the guidance of our creator, let us march forward to 42 and beyond, with that singular Belizean faith, that unshakeable belief that the greater glories of tomorrow are sowed today."
To Belizeans at home and abroad I say
Long live Belize.
Que viva Belice.
Happy Independence Day!


"My fellow Belizeans,"
"Effective midday today, 1st November 2022, I declared a hurricane warning for the nation of Belize. This means that NEMO is fully activated countrywide."
"Our Chief Meteorologist, Mr. Ronald Gordon, advised that as of 3:00 p.m. today, the center of Tropical Storm Lisa was 330 miles to the East of Belize City."
"Lisa is moving to the West at 15 miles per hour and is expected to strengthen to a hurricane overnight. By the time it makes landfall tomorrow, anywhere between Dangriga and Belize City, it is expected to strengthen into a strong category one or a minimal category two hurricane."
"By now, we all should have put our emergency plans into effect. We encourage everyone who feels as if their home is not safe or is at risk to voluntarily relocate to a safe place."
"Shelters all across the country will be opened at 6:00 this evening. The international airport will be closed tonight, and tomorrow, sea ports will be closed and bus transportation will stop at midday."
I call on all employers to release their employees so they can reach to a safe location.
"From our public officers who are manning our hurricane shelters, to our men and women in uniform already on the ground working, we need your cooperation for us to get everyone to safety and keep order in our shelters."
The search and rescue agencies are ready and our doctors and nurses are fully equipped and supplied to attend to the needs of those who remain in the hospitals or who will need emergency assistance.
Remember to stay indoors and out of harm’s way until the official all clear is declared. Please only listen to official advisories coming from the National Met Service and NEMO.
We have done everything we can to prepare for the arrival of the storm and I urge all Belizeans to take the warnings and advisories seriously to preserve your life and the lives of your families.
Together and with the guidance of our Creator we will get through this.
God bless you.
God bless Belize.
I thank you.


"I rise to provide the annual accounting of the public finances and the economy, to review the performance of the National Budget for the current Fiscal Year 2022/23, and to present Government’s Estimate of Revenues and Expenditures for Fiscal Year 2023/24."
"At the onset, let me take this opportunity to acknowledge the efforts of the women of Belize and their indispensable role in the building of our nation."

"Madam Speaker, the month of March is dedicated to women worldwide."
"For us, it is a time not only to celebrate our incredible Belizean women but, also a time for us, to recognize the tremendous work ahead if we are to make Belize a truly inclusive nation."
"I look to a day, Madam Speaker, when this chamber will be equally represented by women and men alike."
"I also envision the day when from the office of the Prime Minister to the Office of the Sargent at Arms, will be occupied by women."
"For now, we on this side will continue our work to include women in all levels of leadership and government."
"To this end, I am happy to say that in both chambers of this National Assembly, we have women in the lead."
"In the Judiciary we have a woman chief justice and, while in the Cabinet women are in the minority, at all other levels of leadership in my administration women serve as leaders, from chief executive officers to heads of departments."
And I must say that Belizean women are great leaders and managers and should be credited for being equal partners in the great performance of this government.
"This is one of, if not the most, inclusive governments in the history of our nation."
"A few weeks ago, after a passionate appeal from my wife, the Special Envoy for the Development of Families and Children, as well as the Minister of Human Development, Families and Indigenous People’s Affairs Hon. Dolores Balderamos Garcia, Cabinet determined that effective 1st April all taxes will be removed from sanitary products for women."
"Madam Speaker, as the member from Belize Rural Central said to her Cabinet colleagues, it is past time that we put an end to taxing women’s femininity, something she attributed to young Seidi Quetzal who is running a campaign, “Don’t Tax My Femininity.”"
"So, from all of us to women everywhere and to you, Madam Speaker, I say thank you, and Happy Women’s Month! #Embrace Equity."
"At the close of March, this Administration will complete its second full budget year, and I am exceedingly proud to proclaim that our second year, like the first, has attained surpassing successes for Belize and for our people."
"By almost every measure of economic progress, Belize is doing so much better than before we took office."
"The economy is growing, expanding in 2022 by an estimated 12.4 percent, more than 10 times the average annual growth rate of 1.7 percent experienced under the UDP administration."
"Comparing these two trajectories, at the UDP administration’s average annual rate of growth, it would have taken almost two generations, a half a century ─ 50 years — for Belize’s economy to double in size."
"With the rate of growth experienced and projected under my administration, our economy will double in size in just about ten years."
That means a lot more money in ALL our pockets much faster.
We said it!
"We meant it and yes,"
Everybody wins!
More Belizeans have jobs ─ 95 percent of those who seek employment are working.
"42,965 workers have received a one dollar and seventy cents or 51 percent per hour salary increase because of the recent increase in the minimum wage to 5 dollars per hour."
"The skeptics on the other side said it couldn’t be done, they said who comes next would face the worst."
Yet here we are:
"68,000 fewer Belizeans are poor, according to the last poverty assessment."
Exports are rising.
Serious crimes are falling.
"Fourteen thousand public officers, teachers and security personnel received a restoration of their full wages last July."
"And a few weeks from now, more specifically, starting 1st of April, we will restore increments for our deserving public officers, teachers, police, BDF and coast guard."
"For the first time in a generation, Belize’s public debt is deemed sustainable, as the country’s indebtedness has been cut in half in just the last two years."
"And once again, I table a new budget today that contains a primary surplus and a budget that does not include any tax increases WHATSOEVER!"
"Quite the opposite of tax increases, last year, three million DOLLARS monthly or 100 thousand dollars per day in taxes was foregone by our Administration in order to moderate the increase in the pump price of fuel to keep it as stable as possible."
"Today, on the world stage, in direct consequence of a sustained effort by this Administration to mobilise private sector innovation and capital, to refocus public investments on education, healthcare and vital infrastructure and to build alliances with IFIs, bilateral partners and NGO partners, Belize’s position and profile sparkle and shimmer like never before."
In just the last few weeks alone Belize has:
"played host to a senior delegation of executive directors from the World Bank, representing 68 countries;"
hosted the President of the IDB;
served as the venue for the annual meeting of the IDB Governors for Central America and the Dominican Republic;
concluded the most positive IMF Article IV Consultation in decades;
"hosted the Investment Conference: “Initiative 20 by 20, Bonn Challenge, and AFOLU 2040 Joint Meeting on Restoring Lands;"
signed the first major disbursement of 10 million U.S. dollars from the United States MCC Agreement in support of education and reducing the cost of electricity;
"and, assumed the Chairmanship of SICA following our eventful Chairmanship of CARICOM."
"And in this month when we celebrate the achievements of women worldwide, we can report the successful implementation of the Women Economic Empowerment Project, which in its first full year of implementation, has already included 44 new initiatives worth more than 2.6 million dollars."
"How distant now do those bleak, final days of the UDP appear, those desperate times when the government had to borrow a million dollars a day to pay public officer salaries and borrow just to keep the lights on?"
How distant now are those traumatic times when Belize had effectively defaulted on its international commercial debt and when the devaluation of our dollar seemed inevitable?
"To that chaos and hopelessness, we shall never return. Not so long as we remain faithful to our sacred pledge that “Everybody Fi Win   Todos Ganamos!”."
"In a meaningful partnership with the people and day by day, we have kept moving forward delivering on Plan Belize."
"Day by day we have kept our focus on addressing poverty, educating our children, keeping our citizens safe, providing adequate healthcare for all, as well as protecting our environment."
Together with the support of citizens from all walks of life we are and will continue to be extra for Belize.
"In my presentation, today, I propose to address five broad themes:"
"First, to outline domestic and regional economic conditions;"
"Second, to review financial sector and real economy developments;"
"Third, to report on the projected performance of this year’s Budget which ends on 31st March 2023;"
"Fourth, to summarize the estimates for the new Budget, which starts on 1st April 2023;"
"And lastly, to highlight select policies and reforms that can have a substantial impact on the economy, the public finances and, most importantly, the quality of life for the citizens we are sworn to serve."

First to External Conditions:
The performance of the economy and the budget is shaped by many issues outside of Government’s control.
"As a small, open, and vulnerable economy, external factors such as extreme climate events, global economic shocks like that caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, high inflation suffered by the U.S. and our other major trading partners, supply chain disruptions, trade regulations, among others, can either help or hinder our fortunes."
"For context, global GDP expanded by 3.7 percent in 2022, down from 6.5 percent in 2021."
"Growth in the Latin American region averaged 3.9 percent in 2022, with the notable performances being the United States of America at growth rates 2 percent, Mexico at 1.7 percent and the Caribbean at 10.3 percent."
"Growth in Central America moderated to 4.2 percent, down from the 5.5 percent in the previous year."
"In 2023, GDP growth in the United States is projected by the IMF at a paltry 1.4 percent while the global rate of economic growth will fall for the second consecutive year to 2.9 percent."
"The Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022, and the attendant impacts on fuel and food prices and supply chains, provoked the return of high inflation after two decades of relative price stability."
"Global inflation reached 8.8 percent in 2022, a level exceeded only once in the previous 26 years."
"While the year 2022 will be remembered for its return to the “old normal,”  following almost two years of pandemic disruption and social distancing, the prospect of rising interest rates, necessary to tame the beast of inflation, as well as the unmistakable pattern of climate-induced calamities, foreshadow a possible recession in the United States, the country most connected to our economy."
Of special importance for Belize is the trajectory of tourism: global overnight travel is expected to grow by 28 percent and the cruise sector by 13 percent.
This will undoubtedly have a positive impact on our tourism sector.
"Over the last 12 months, every major interest rate has seen an uptick."
These increases have the effect of slowing growth and commercial activity worldwide.
"The year 2023, by all accounts, will be a difficult year for the U.S. economy, with the almost universal belief being that the Caribbean and Latin America will see a deceleration of economic activity."
"In Belize, annual economic growth, according to the latest Statistical Institute of Belize data, reached 12.4 percent in 2022, an impressive jump and double what the IMF had predicted in last year’s Article Four Report."
This 12.4 percent rate of growth is even more momentous since it comes on the heels of 15.2 percent growth in 2021.
"Of course, the growth was not uniform across all subsectors."
"In the primary sector which edged lower by 0.9 percent during 2022, lobster, chicken and yellow corn saw increases while banana, citrus, shrimp and cattle experienced contractions."
"In the secondary sector where growth was 11.9 percent, increases were achieved in sugar, beverage production, construction supplies and domestic electricity generation."
"On the other hand, citrus juice, fertilizer and imported electricity weakened."
"In the tertiary sector, which grew at a vibrant pace of 13 percent for the year, there was almost uniform growth."
Growth in accommodations and food service.
"Growth in wholesale and retail trade, transportation, support services including the BPO sector and public administration."
Only in financial and insurance activities was there a small decline.
"Notably, domestic exports rose by 46 million dollars, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) by 15.7 million dollars for the first nine months of the year, and remittances by 14 million dollars."
"The Central Bank of Belize conservatively foresees net FDI, which totalled 261 million dollars in 2022, remaining above a yearly total of 200 million dollars right through to 2027."
"This will be chiefly in businesses related to tourism and leisure, agri-business and agro-processing, fisheries and aquaculture, offshore outsourcing and other industries such as sustainable energy, light manufacturing and logistics."
"Inflation in Belize rose to 6.3 percent for 2022, up from 3.2 percent in 2021."
"Still, these rates were far below the global rates of 8.8 percent in 2022 and 4.7 percent  in 2021."
"What is remarkable, though, is that 2022 GDP output has exceeded 2019 levels even though tourism arrivals remain materially below this key subsector’s 2019 performance."
"On this basis, there appears to be great potential for continued growth in 2023, in tourism and across the economy."

"Madam Speaker,"
Monetary and financial conditions stabilised in 2022 and fundamental indicators remain strong.
A resurgence in lending to the private sector and the continued solid growth in the gross official reserves of the Central Bank underpinned a 4.7 percent money supply expansion.
"During the year, the net foreign assets and net domestic credit of the banking system   the two largest components of money supply   grew by 5.2 percent and 5.7 percent, respectively."
"On the one hand, the rise in net foreign assets was solely attributable to the 14 percent growth in the Central Bank’s foreign portfolio as those of domestic banks dipped slightly."
"The elevated position of the monetary authority’s foreign balances occurred despite an increase in external debt servicing, as robust inflows from sugar export receipts, grants and purchases from commercial banks increased reserves."
"Meanwhile, domestic banks’ net foreign assets decreased by 7.3 percent on account of the higher outlays for imported goods and services due to inflation, alongside the full-scale resumption of profit repatriation and dividend payments to international firms."
"Notwithstanding these outflows from banks’ foreign holdings, increased foreign revenues flowed into the banking system from tourism, BPOs, commercial freezone activity, and exports of agricultural products."
"On the other hand, credit to all three economic agents increased, led by an upswing in lending to the private sector, and to a lesser extent, quasi-governmental entities, and Central Government."
"Central Bank’s Gross Official Reserves stood tall at 960 million dollars at the close of 2022, with import cover comfortably exceeding the recommended three-month cover."
The IMF projects this level to be maintained through to 2028.
"Private sector borrowings climbed by 104 million dollars or 4.5 percent, nearly double last year’s outturn, and the largest annual increase since 2019."
"Bank liquidity inched up by 4.6 million dollars in 2022, following increases of 219.5 million dollars and 278.1 million dollars in 2020 and 2021, respectively."
The slowdown in liquidity growth was on account of the pickup in lending and the decline in domestic banks’ foreign asset holdings.
"Regrettably, as a result, excess liquidity amounted to 702.9 million dollars, 91.9 percent above requirements, a situation which the regulator is actively reviewing."
"Excess cash reserves summed to 499.3 million dollars, 211 percent above the required level."
"Weighted average lending rates decreased by two basis points to 8.62 percent during the year, while weighted average deposit rates slipped by 15 basis points to 1.90 percent."
"As a result, the weighted average interest rate spread widened by 13 basis points."
"As the IMF underscored, the regulatory capital of domestic banks at 16.6 percent of risk weighted assets, is higher than the required minimum but lower than before the pandemic."
"Non-performing Loans (NPLs) have crept higher to 7 percent of gross loans, a shade higher than the prudential ceiling of 5 percent, primarily due to pandemic-induced business contractions and, in some cases, excessive risk-taking."
"Nonetheless, the IMF concludes that “the Central Bank’s process for strengthening the banks’ balance sheets and resolving problem loans after the pandemic has been well executed."
The CBB has sufficient tools should it need to intervene.”
I now turn to the actual performance of revenues and expenditures for this Fiscal Year 2022/23.
"Total revenues and grants are projected to come in at 1,356 million dollars, of which 89 percent is tax revenue, 8 percent is non-tax revenue and 3 percent in capital revenue and grants."
"Actual revenue and grants exceeded the original budgeted amount by approximately 6.9 percent or 93 million dollars, an over-performance of 89 million dollars, which is attributed to tax revenues."
"On the expenditure side, total spending, including supplementary allocations approved during the Fiscal Year is expected to be 1,436 million dollars, which is 71 million dollars or 5 percent more than the original estimate."
"Recurrent expenditure will come in 48 million dollars more than the original estimates while investments in capital projects will total approximately 397 million dollars, or an additional 119 million dollars."
"This year’s budget will require total financing of about 178 million dollars, to be sourced from the following loan facilities:"
"120 million dollars from the IFI lenders, namely the IDB, the CDB, the World Bank, CABEI and the OPEC Fund,"
30 million dollars from the Republic of China (Taiwan );
and 28 million dollars from domestic borrowing.
"Once again, Belize benefitted from the generosity of the Government and People of the Republic of China (Taiwan), to whom I offer our abiding appreciation."
"At the bottom line for this Fiscal Year, Government expects a Primary Surplus of half a percent of GDP or roughly 31 million dollars."
"The Primary Surplus is an important gauge of budget health, representing the difference between revenues and expenditures, but without interest charges."
"A positive primary balance such that we achieved in FY 2021/22 as well as this Fiscal Year, is a clear signal of our  fiscal strength and our capacity to sustain our debt."
"The Overall Deficit, which includes interest cost, is projected to be 1.38 percent  or 80.5 million dollars, a level that is affordable."
"During the Budget Debate, Ministers will delve deeper into the financial details of their portfolios but allow me to highlight some of the major capital projects funded from our external partners."
"These include, as thirteen examples,"
"(1) ongoing upgrading of the Caracol Road,"
"(2) ongoing upgrading of the Coastal Road,"
"(3) upgrading of the Philip Goldson Highway and Remate Bypass Project,"
"(4) upgrading of the Sarteneja Road and the construction of a new bridge at Laguna,"
"(5) the new Haulover Bridge,"
"(6) the completion of 3 miles of the Nago Bank Road under the Resilient Rural Belize Program,"
"(7) the Natural Disaster Management Project & Climate Vulnerability Reduction Program,"
"(8) a new tranche for the Social Investment Fund,"
"(9) the Strengthening and Digitization of Tax Administration,"
"(10) The Education Quality Improvement Project & the Education Reform Program,"
"(11) the Sustainable Tourism Program,"
"(12) the construction of police and defence facilities and the procurement of equipment including forensic equipment under the Belize Integral Security Program, and"
(13) the new loan program at the DFC designed specifically for MSME’s especially women led small businesses.
"As if these were not already great achievements, through the Social Investment Fund we inaugurated six school projects, provided laptops for every child as a part of the Belize City South Side free-education program, constructed three polyclinics and built three new water systems all at a value of 14 million dollars."

"Madam Speaker, while progress is being made on many fronts, I would like to take time to highlight one in particular   and that is the remarkable turn-around at the Lands Department."
"At the start of our administration, our backlog instruments were at over 20,000."
"Already we have managed to reduce that to 2,687."
"In the 2022/23 fiscal year alone, we cleared 9,860 instruments."
"In fiscal year 2022/23, National Estate produced approximately 10,000 lease approvals, purchase approvals, grants and land certificates."
The land mobiles are a huge part of eradicating the backlogs that haunted the Ministry for the past 13 years.
We practically held a land clinic every two and a half weeks   equally split between public land clinics and internal land clinics; a total of 22 land clinics combined.
"But perhaps more refreshingly and instructive for the economy, is that we are at this minute concluding a special land clinic for the Land Registry.  That saw the completion of 2,500 land certificates and land titles   reducing the backlogs there by 50 percent."
"And that does not include the over 14,000 land certificates, deeds and Transfer Certificate of Titles that have been issued over the course of the fiscal year."
"All these efforts, the reduction of the backlogs at National Estate from 20,000 to under 3,000, and the halving of the Land Registry backlogs from 5,000 to 2,500 will allow the Ministry to get current   to now ensure that the wait time for lease approvals, and purchase approvals, and land certificates and land transfers are cut down considerably."
"In the past year, we distributed a little over 1,000 purchase approvals and titles to what we call the Super Constituencies   the teachers, nurses, police officers, public officers and Belize Defence Force soldiers."
"And as we speak, 10,000 lots are being surveyed all over the country so that we can reach first-time land owners as well as more public officers, teachers and nurses, and members of our police and security forces."
And in this coming financial year we will do even more!

I now report on the public debt.
"In December 2022, the total public debt stood at 4.031 million dollars or the equivalent of 64.1 percent of GDP."
"2.716 million dollars represented loans to external lenders, while 1.314 million dollars was owed by Government to domestic creditors."
67 cents of every dollar of debt are owed to foreign creditors and 33 cents of every dollar to local creditors.
"To meet the terms of this debt stock during this fiscal year, Government paid some 112 million dollars in interest and 97.5 million dollars in principal repayments."
"Of every dollar in total revenue and grants for this budget year, Government therefore paid 8 cents in interest."
"The average interest rate on the public debt comes in just under 3 percent, though rising interest rates globally will nudge upward the cost of financing the public debt."
"Each year, going back 20 years, the IMF, based on what is called a debt sustainability analysis, has appraised Belize’s public debt as unsustainable, which is double speak for credit distress and potential default."
"That being the case, there is a special sense of achievement to quote from this year’s IMF Article Four Concluding Statement:"
"“The Government has achieved a large reduction in the public debt…from 133% of old GDP to 101% of new GDP, …to 80% of GDP in 2021,… to 64.1% in 2022.”"
"And the Statement provides the specific measures that resulted in this spectacular achievement of reducing the public debt from 133 percent of old GDP to 64.1 percent of new GDP, and I quote:"
"“the rebasing of national accounts, sizable fiscal consolidation, the debt for marine protection swap, strong GDP growth, expenditure containment including a temporary 10 percent cut to public sector wages and the suspension of wage increments during FY 2021/23, a strong recovery of revenue and a material discount on the debt owed to Venezuela under Petrocaribe.”"
End of quote
"I invite those on the other side to consider this fact: the public debt surged by two billion dollars between 2009 and 2020, from 2.2 billion dollars to 4.2 billion dollars."
"In contrast, this Administration, through its public debt management operations, has reduced the amount owed by the Government by over one billion dollars   315 million US dollars in debt reduction attributable to the Super Bond/Blue Bond transaction, which includes the principal reinstatement Belize avoided; up to 163 million U.S. dollars of Petrocaribe debt from the recent reduction provided by Venezuela; and 39 million U.S. dollars in damages avoided as a result of last September’s settlement of the compensation claims for Belize International Services Ltd (BISL)   a grand total of 517 million US dollars of debt reduction."
"And the IMF projects that debt to GDP will fall to 53 percent of GDP by 2028 while interest payments on debt will not exceed 1.8 percent of GDP, more or less the current level of debt servicing costs."
"Rescuing our dollar from devaluation while restoring Belize’s credit worthiness are without question, epoch-making accomplishments of this PUP Administration and we were able to do this in just two short years!"
"At the start of this year, and after sweeping deliberations, the Government shared with stakeholders and the public, Belize’s Medium Term Development Strategy (MTDS)."
The action plan is founded on six key cornerstones:
"Poverty reduction,"
"economic transformation and growth,"
"trade deficit reduction,"
"Citizen Security,"
Protection of the Environment and
Stopping Corruption.
224 Programs and Projects are identified as critical for the achievements of targets in each area of focus.
"And these programs and projects in turn interlock with the Ministry of Finance’s Five-Year Fiscal Forecast, including the flow of funding from both external and domestic sources."
"Into the 5-year horizon, both the IMF and the Central Bank expect revenue and grants to average 23 percent of GDP; wages, pensions, goods and services and subsidies and transfers at 16 percent of GDP, debt servicing at just under 2 percent of the GDP"
"and crucially, capital investments at 5.6 percent of GDP."
"At these levels, the primary balance remains positive, and the overall deficit stays below 1 percent of GDP, a level that can be financed."
It is that last number   capital spending   which represents less than 20 cents of every dollar at Government’s disposal from revenue and grants that largely funds the programs and projects necessary for the attainment of the objectives of the Medium Term Development Strategy.
"This will enlarge this investment pool and yes, public sector wages and operational-related spending must be contained."
"To this end, tax collections must continue to improve and new sources of financing, such as the Green Climate Fund, must be maximized."
Belize cannot and should not expect that the great leap forward will be funded by handouts or reparations for the climate catastrophe caused by the so-called developed countries.
"While we pursue novel sources of financing, what remains within our control is to reduce waste, to ensure those who should, pay their fair share, and we must work to reduce the 70 cents out of every dollar of public funds that is being consumed by non-capital spending."
Consider Hurricane Lisa as an example.
"Lisa made landfall just south of Belize City last November at the very end of the hurricane season, causing substantial losses."
"NEMO estimates damages totaling 212.4 million dollars with 172,000 Belizeans affected by the storm."
And how much financial support came from external sources?
"A grand total of 2.2 million US dollars, a mere drop in the bucket, most of which came from our Central American development partner, CABEI, with whom we are truly grateful."
"Fortunately, this administration had by then created sufficient fiscal space for supplementary allocations, which addressed the most urgent needs of our people."
Let me now outline the estimates of revenues and expenditures for the new Fiscal year 2023/24.
"The Ministry of Finance projects total revenues and grants of 1.408 billion dollars comprised of tax revenues of 1.372 billion dollars, non-tax revenues of 112 million dollars,"
capital revenues of 5.5 million dollars and grants of 30 million dollars.
The sub-categories of tax revenues are as follows:
"(1) taxes on goods and services that account for 49 cents of every tax dollar,"
"(2) taxes on income and profits accounting for 26 cents of every tax dollar,"
"(3) taxes on international trade and transactions accounting for 18 cents of every tax dollar,"
"(4) and taxes on property, accounting for less than 1 cent of each tax dollar collected."
"On the expenditure side, a total of 1.496 billion dollars is proposed."
"Of this sum, 1.112 billion dollars is classified as recurrent spending, this covers wages, pensions, goods and services, subsidies and transfers and debt service interest costs."
I am pleased to confirm that effective 1st April the wage provisions include the resumption of increments for public officers.
This will be merit based and comes a full 12 months prior to the original date for restoration.
"In addition to recurrent costs, 383.4 million dollars is programmed for capital investments during the new Fiscal Year, of which some 158 million dollars are so called Capital 3 funding, drawn down from the various loans and grants already approved."
"One hundred and eight million dollars is the amount projected for amortization payments; that is, the repayment of principal on loans already contracted."
The Budget for Fiscal Year 2023/24 is forecasted with a primary surplus of 24.3 million dollars or 0.39 percent of GDP. That GDP is  projected to be a robust 6.253 billion dollars of economic output.
Inflation for 2023 is forecasted at 4.1 percent.
"The overall deficit for Fiscal Year 2023/24 will be 1.41 percent of GDP, or some 88.1 million dollars."
Budget financing requirements including amortizations will total 210 million dollars to be sourced from the following facilities:
Loans from International Financial Institutions   128 million dollars
Grants from our Bilateral Partners   30 million dollars
Domestic Financing   54 million dollars.
"In addition to several of the major multi-year capital projects to receive funding once again in this FY   such as the Caracol, Coastal and Sarteneja Roads, the Philip Goldson Highway, the Remate Bypass and the Haulover Bridge, the upgrading of 4.7 miles of the Valley of Peace Road, 3 miles of the San Carlos Road and 3 miles of the Trio Road under the Resilient Rural Belize Program, among others."
New project funding will also flow to these programs:
(1)   The San Estevan Road Construction Project
(2)   The Strengthening Public Expenditure Management Project
(3)   The Lands and Civil Registry Digitization Project
"(4)   The Sustainable and Inclusive MSME Program, and"
"(5)   The Trade and Investment Facilitation Project, among others."

"Madam Speaker, apart from the on-going support for the recurrent and capital programs, this new budget will focus on several priority areas in keeping with our Medium Term Development Strategy and with the overarching goals of Plan Belize."
More money is being provided for following high priority areas:
* An additional 4.0 million dollars to expand the Free Education Program to schools in the Southside of Belize City and in the Toledo District.
"* An additional 1.0 million dollars to fund the surveying and processing cost for lots for first-time, low-income homeowners."
* An additional 7.0 million dollars for the expansion of the National Health Insurance Program in the Orange Walk District.
* An additional 3.0 million dollars for municipal streets and drains.
"* An increase of 5.0 million dollars to meet the recruitment of an additional 225 police cadets, 110 BDF recruits, and some 60 coast guard recruits."
* An additional 1.0 million dollars to support the Financial Intelligence Unit including the establishment of a Civil Asset Forfeiture and Recovery Unit to combat corruption.
"Let me say this Madam Speaker, as a result of my taking time to visit communities across this nation, having spoken and interacted with Belizeans from every walk of life, and fielding questions time and again from the press about the rising cost of living, I am aware that with all our successes of the past year, there are still many Belizeans who believe they are working harder and spending more for less."
We all are.
The fact is that the global shocks I laid out earlier are affecting people worldwide.
"To alleviate this, we have to spend more of our income on Belizean-made products, invest more in Belizean ingenuity and creativity and waste less, and budget smart."
One example of this Madam Speaker is the progress we have made in the soybean industry.
"With the increase in production of soybean concentrate, the importation of soybean as animal feed and cooking oil has been reduced at a savings of 25 million dollars."
"Through collaboration and partnerships with the private sector and other stakeholders, the Government of Belize has transformed itself into an effective, forward-looking, fiscally disciplined entity that places the support of our Belizean businesses at the heart of Plan Belize, which will continue to pursue efforts for the implementation of the MSME Strategy."
"The National MSME Roadshow is an initiative that lent support to the MSMEs across Belize under the following pillars: capacity building, access to finance, policy and legislative reform, MSME formalization, and market access."
This national effort was implemented between August to November 2022 and complimented the drive to support local businesses by buying locally-produced goods and services.
"This support is crucial, given small businesses’ important role in creating jobs, strengthening communities, and increasing economic prosperity."
"To combat the challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, the rising costs of doing business, and increased competition as a consequence of globalization, we joined forces to ensure that MSMEs have opportunities for fair access to finance and other support programs that will improve their competitiveness."
"This government supports our MSMEs, promoting buying Belize and remaining engaged in our country’s development as MSMEs have shown that in the majority they are women-owned and or women-led."
"To build upon what was started, Government approved a Fiscal Incentive Bill that provides incentives across the spectrum of MSMEs and very importantly, reduces the time to approval for both foreign and local investments."
These incentives also offer Micro and Small businesses the option to formalize an amnesty upon registration and provide a year’s exemption from Business Tax.
All MSMEs under the Fiscal Incentive Program will be allowed to register for GST to qualify them to obtain their GST refund.
Another very important incentive is with Government procurement in which the Fiscal Incentive Program recognizes MSMEs and allows them to supply the goods or services they produce to Government.
"The Fiscal Incentive Program is earmarking 20 percent of all government procurement tenders to MSMEs, that is 20 percent of the Government’s Forecasted Budget for 2024/2025 equaling approximately 45 Million dollars."
"The other incentive tool is the One Off incentive which will allow the importation of goods for capital investments, and this will expire after 12 months and will not exceed one million dollars of imported goods."
"The intention of this investment tool is for businesses that wish to quickly import machinery or equipment to increase production or to expand in a short period of time, due to demand in the market."
"In the very near future, the Government of Belize, through the Ministry of Investment and Beltraide, along with our partners in the private sector and civil society, will embark on a massive campaign to sensitize all Belizeans that buying local will benefit the country."
It is the smart thing to do!

"Madam Speaker,"
"This Financial Year 2022/23, Government will have spent 95 million dollars on the pension plan for public officials."
"In the next budget, 2023/24 the spending rises to 100 million dollars."
"The IMF estimates that the present value of this pension liability is 77 percent of GDP, more than the entire public debt of the country."
"I have said publicly, and I say again: this budget line spending is neither sustainable nor fair."
"To illustrate, this year the SSB is projected to collect some 140 million dollars in contributions and pay out some 110 million dollars in benefits. This is the nature of a contributory pension scheme."
"Belize is an outlier in every material respect so far as retirement age, replacement rate, and contribution rate are concerned."
"Everywhere else in the Caribbean and Latin America, public officers’ pension schemes are contributory."
"The average replacement rate, that is, the average pension divided by average earnings in the entire Latin America and Caribbean Region is 61.9 percent."
"In Belize, the average replacement rate for public officers, when combining social security pension at 27.9 percent and public officers’ non-contributory pension at 67.5 percent, both of which public officers would be entitled to, is 95.4 percent, a whopping 33.5 percent above the regional average."
"In most of the region, the voluntary age of retirement is 60 years and mandatory retirement age of 65 years."
"In the Caribbean, countries with special pension plans for public officials tend to have higher retirement ages, 60 years in the case of Trinidad & Tobago and Suriname, for example, and 65 years plus in the case of Jamaica, Barbados, Antigua and Barbuda."
"The IMF has presented their formula for public pension reform and sustainability which involves a contribution rate of 10 percent (of wages), half of which ─ or 5 percent ─ to be contributed by public officers; raising the current retirement age from 55 to 65; and reducing the replacement rate from 67 percent to 50 percent, all to be gradually phased in over time."
"I’m happy to report that at a recent meeting of the Ministerial Consulting Team that has been engaged in meetings with the Joint Unions on the important issues of Increments and Pension Reform, significant progress was made."
"The update was positive, as the Joint Unions have agreed to a phased implementation of a contributory pension scheme, having recognized that the current pension scheme is unsustainable."
"The first phase of the contributory pension scheme will commence with persons entering the Public Service as of 1st July 2023; and the unions have agreed to work with the Government on mechanisms for a second phase rollout, where other public officers will be included in the contributory pension scheme."
"For sure, we must applaud our ministerial team but, more so, the Joint Unions team for this historic and unprecedented collaboration and achievement."
"We look forward to the continuation of constructive, reasoned and respectful dialogue."
"Quite apart from the categorical steps this Administration has already adopted in the pursuit of national prosperity, the recent IMF report singles out several of the policy enhancements that are already in train."
These include:
"access to affordable credit for micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises"
the Credit Reporting Act
the impending Credit Bureau and Collateral Registry
the electronic invoice module and the modernization of the Fiscal Incentives Act
the digitization of the land and the business registries
the single investment window
the digitization of firms and government services
updating the national risk assessment and AML/CFT strategy
steps to mitigate the financial integrity risks in the international financial sector
and the legal framework for restricting activities involving virtual assets.

This sequence of policy and legislative action is a small sampling of creative solutions this Administration has advocated as we strive towards our strategic objectives.
"Looking forward, the legislative agenda planned for the new fiscal year includes several key pieces of legislation all aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of public finance management and administration."
These include:
A new Procurement and Assets Disposal Act
A new Public Financial Management Act
A new Property Transaction Tax Act
And Tax Administration Legislation.

"Madam Speaker, my Cabinet colleagues and I realize that we cannot reverse the prevalence of poverty overnight."
"But, our policies and this budget reflect a passionate determination to hasten that reversal."
"The recent analysis, published earlier this week by the Statistical Institute of Belize, showed the rate falling from a UDP-produced high of 52 percent to 35.9 percent."
This is an encouraging start.
"So are the 7,478 new jobs created in 2022."
"The opportunity to work at a minimum wage, now five dollars per hour, is the most basic step out of poverty."
"Education, we all know is also a critical antidote to poverty."
"That’s why the free secondary school education program is being funded to the tune of 6.4 million dollars providing support to 2,600 students who would otherwise not be in the classrooms."
"And the novel STEAM Program, set for launch in the new school year with an inaugural class of 75 students, adds one more option for acquiring professional skills."
"Housing, the thousands of homes we plan to construct, whether public or private sector built, supported by housing development incentive programs, is another lift out of poverty."
"So far, 260 starter homes have been delivered and another 200 will be completed in this fiscal year."
"There is one other massive, though often overlooked, antidote to poverty and that’s land."
"Whether for a home, a small farm or simply as an asset to be leveraged for greater financial independence, a parcel can be a gateway out of poverty."
"And that is why, with support from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Natural Resources, is spearheading a survey and distribution program for almost 11,000 parcels in areas of all six districts."
Final surveys have been funded and are almost completed.
Assigning a modest value of ten thousand per lot would mean that this program alone represents a 110-million-dollar transfer of wealth to qualified landowners.
"Now, that is truly transformational governance."

"Madam Speaker,"
There is no duty more sacrosanct than the management of the public purse.
"Taxes paid to the state are the product of the blood, sweat and tears of hardworking citizens, who rightfully expect those they elect to allocate these monies wisely."
And they expect those in the public service to spend these monies carefully.
"The value of a dollar does not change whether that dollar is directed towards the 132- million-dollar construction of the new Coastal Road or the purchase of a new 800-dollar weed cutter for, say, the village of Scotland Halfmoon."
I will therefore never tire of demanding diligence and honesty   value for the people’s money   from those in Parliament with executive responsibility as well as those public officials who oversee the budgetary and spending processes of government.
"The public officers, the projects and the programs funded by this budget are all directed toward the betterment of life for Belizeans and the security of Belize as a nation-state."
"From the proceeds of this budget, over four hundred thousand of us, living in cities, towns and villages, should all benefit, many directly but all in aggregate."
"In two short years, this Administration has rekindled trust in the public finance, recouping and far overshooting the pre-pandemic output of the economy and the scope of public sector spending and investments."
"The magic, the marvel of Plan Belize has only just started."
"We push on ensuring that our efforts will lead to more homes, more of our children in schools, more persons included in NHI, more land in the hands of first-time landowners, a more efficient and effective public service, more jobs, a stronger social safety net, safer cities and yes cleaner and greener rivers, streams and sea."
"As we look ahead my administration will not fear, we will not weep, we choose to be bold, and we are determined to do more and to be extra for Belize."
"From Consejo in the North to Barranco in the South, from Benque Viejo in the West to the Lighthouse Reef islands in the East, a brighter sun shines, a different, more confident nation awakens."
"And with the guidance of our Creator, let us stride forward, perhaps stumbling at times but always moving forward, to that noble land where justice and prosperity abound and where every Belizean shall share in this “wealth untold.”"
Thank you.
"Madam Speaker, this bill has the recommendation of the Cabinet."
"Señor Presidente, y mi amigo, su Excelencia, Doctor Alejandro Giammattei Falla, presidente de la Republica de Guatemala. Gracias por esta calurosa bienvenida a la bella Antigua, como siempre es usted un anfitron excelente."
"My fellow ACS Heads of Government and delegation leaders; ACS Secretary General, Mr. Rodolfo Sabonge; Secretary General of CARICOM, Dr. Carla Barnett; and Secretary General of SICA, Mr. Werner Vargas; H.E. Mario Bucaro, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Guatemala, and his excellent and hardworking team, members of the diplomatic and consular corps, the staff of the ACS Secretariat and other distinguished colleagues and friends; ladies and gentlemen."
"The international system in which we live and operate is facing multiple crises: political, economic, social, and environmental; all being interconnected and unsolvable if approached in isolation. Increased regional coordination and collaboration is an essential tool to address the many challenges."
"First, the COVID-19 pandemic battered our economies both in terms of production losses and significant increase in our debt burden. These challenges are now further exacerbated by conflict in Europe. However, we should not lose sight of the fact that even before these more recent global events, the structural challenges hampering development were already entrenched."
"In terms of economics, the consequences of the conflict in Eastern Europe have been felt around the world with the rising cost of wheat, fertilizers and oil; meaning that regardless of political views, the cost of living for our people has gone up, along with rising food insecurity."
"In consideration of these factors, national governments are hard-pressed to meet domestic demands and, if we are to be fully honest, even more so to meet multilateral demands with our limited resources. This has been amply aired in the extended and candid debate over the last two days on the perilous state of finances of the ACS Secretariat."
"The question we should now posit is: how will the ACS remain relevant and viable while addressing these seemingly insurmountable challenges? We would like to suggest that the organization returns to its roots ─ the Caribbean Sea ─ and in the first instance, in addition to our robust political dialogue, focus should be intensified in two thematic areas: the first being the maritime transport challenge, which hinders greater economic interaction and integration amongst ACS states and the second, should be focusing attention on disaster risk management amongst ACS states."
"I am confident in saying that the challenges faced by member states are more homogenous than we realize. Addressing these obstacles requires a concerted effort of national governments, international agencies, non-state actors and perhaps, most importantly, the private sector. The ACS must transform itself into a hub for sustained dialogue among the named actors to find actionable solutions in the areas identified."
"I will end my remarks on a positive note. The ACS has been in existence for over 29 years and this 9th Summit demonstrates the high-level political commitment of the contracting states, countries, and territories to maintain this forum for “consultation, cooperation and concerted action;” despite the naysayers."
"Additionally, it is imperative for the ACS to operate more as a coordinator, especially at the executive level.  Finally, since this organization coexists alongside CARICOM and SICA, we need to be skillful in avoiding the trap of duplication and irrelevance and be strategic in identifying our niche and competitive advantage; we are, after all, serving the same people."
I thank you.


"Fellow Heads, I wish to thank our friend, the President of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, for extending this invitation to Belize to be a part of this important initiative."
Belize believes this Anti-Inflation Summit to be commendable and an extremely necessary initiative. It provides an opportunity to engage and work constructively on the many trade and industry development issues that require our collective and dedicated attention and action.
"We, like others in our region, have been dealt a stark reminder that the diversification of our productive base and trading partners is key to building true economic resilience."
"My government has worked diligently to lead a historic rebound in Belize from near economic and social collapse brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, the conflict in Ukraine, and the climate crisis. But our people have been unable to feel sustained economic relief as their spending power continues to be eroded by this generational cost of living crisis."
"The present cost-of-living crisis is arguably the greatest challenge facing our region today, one that can only be overcome when like-minded and progressive leaders work together. Therefore, we welcome this opportunity. At the same time, we call for an extension of the May 16th Presidential Decree, which will complement the New Anti-Inflation Initiatives."
"In building our productive capacity, it is our goal to advance several key sustainable development goals like reducing poverty, promoting decent work for economic growth, and modernizing industry and infrastructure."
It is not lost on us that there will be significant work to do among this eleven-nation alliance. Our countries vary significantly in size and productive capacity and maintain various longstanding trade and economic integration relationships that will have to be accounted for when engineering our new reality.
"As we seek to deepen ties, Belize renews its commitment to our shared goals of promoting the development and integration of our region."
We have an opportunity to reduce barriers to trade for an agreed basket of basic goods for our people. This by strengthening our economic cooperation mechanisms that enhance trade facilitation and increase regional agricultural productivity to attain strategic autonomy in the selected food and services sectors.
"A collective and broad development strategy will ultimately promote regional specialization, economies of scale and mutual economic interdependence of the group of countries participating in the alliance."
The proposal by Mexico for participants of this Summit to agree on a facilitation mechanism to combat inflationary forces and grow intra-regional trade should be embraced by all.
Belize recommends renewed focus on an industrial policy framework that gives meaningful support and incentives to enable investments targeting value-addition and access to established value chains or those to be created.
"Investments should be prioritized in science and technology to support the growth and resilience of the agricultural sector, thereby improving the production of food, and insulating the region’s economies from the adverse impacts of global crises including pandemics."
"Clearly, there is an urgent need to increase the availability of financing accessible by the private sector."
"Belize will continue to benefit greatly from Mexico’s generosity and leadership under the Sembrando Vida project. This project can drive improvements in sustainable agricultural processes and practices, leading to increased productivity, penetration of export markets and financial inclusion. Sembrando Vida captures the spirit of the type of trade and economic cooperation that should define our ambition."
"Excellencies, we have shared interest in leading a region where our economies become more resilient and adaptable. Let us be decisive in our actions but considerate in our deliberations as we seek ways to enhance our relations."


"My fellow Belizeans,"
"This day, 21st September, lifts an enlivened nation to the pinnacle of our annual Celebrations Calendar, as together we salute the various milestones of our glorious march to statehood."
"On behalf of all Belizeans, I welcome the many distinguished visitors who have traveled great distances to show solidarity and to show respect."
"All Belizeans are grateful for your presence here today and I thank our citizens in every village, town and city, who have joined, in person and in spirit, the many events of our Celebration Calendar."
"True to tradition, my remarks today have been preceded by the always imaginative critique of the Leader of the Opposition. How fitting it is for him to fulfill this obligation and to do so even on this paramount day of national unity. In doing so, he demonstrates to our guests and to the world that our democracy is high-spirited and our Constitution vibrant."
Taking stock of our nation’s standing at 42 compels a recognition of the existent regional and global conditions.
"Lamentably, the times are turbulent:"
"A vicious war rages for a second year in Europe, the first conflict of this kind since the end of WWII."
"Climate change ravages the planet, from super storms menacing our region to the forest fires in the northern hemisphere to the catastrophic floods in Africa and Asia."
"A surge of inflation wreaks havoc on the pocketbooks of those who can least afford to pay more for the staples of living. And a deluge of debt of every stripe   sovereign, personal and commercial   risks reversing the post-pandemic recovery, threatening to erode decades of advances for humanity."
"At 42, the downside risks appear formidable and intimidating for a small, open democracy such as ours."
"Despite these obvious and very real challenges, the results of our constant labors since the election of November 2020 show that #PlanBelize, our national plan, our north star, is not just working but working far better than the optimists imagined."
I want to share with you today just a few snapshots of this success.
"Last week, as an example, the IMF concluded its mid-year review, where Staff and the Authorities agreed that 2023 will see economic growth and an expansion of 2022."
"And just as Belize vastly outperformed IMF projections in both 2021 and 2022, we are confident that 2023 will extend this trend of actual performance, surpassing forecasted performance."
"Presently, unemployment is at a historic low, 2.8 percent. That’s as close as Belize has ever been to full employment. Especially pleasing is the forecast for domestic inflation, expected to fall from 6.1 percent last year to 3.7 percent this year."
"The explosive economic growth we have managed, along with the unprecedented bounty of new jobs, has not come at the expense of overspending and new debt."
"In fact, a primary fiscal surplus of 1.2 percent is projected for this year, while the public debt is anticipated to fall below 60 percent of GDP. And we are working to reduce the public debt by significant margins."
"Belize’s financial system has regained its pre-pandemic strength   Central Bank reserves exceed half a billion US dollars or four and a half months of imports, well beyond the recommended 3-month standard."
"The banking system is liquid, non-performing loans stand at the prudential 5 percent level and the Central Bank Act has only recently been revamped to further fortify the toolkit of the Regulator to fulfill its vital mandate."
"In sum, then, the economy is booming, Belizeans are working, our dollar peg is safe, and the medium-term prospects are exceptionally promising."
"No wonder, therefore, that a few weeks ago, when the Second Annual Investment Summit convened on idyllic Ambergris Caye, there were waves of confidence and cheer about investment opportunities in Belize."
"Focusing on Belize’s potential for Orange Economy growth, this latest edition of our investment summit attracted serious commercial interest from every continent, underscoring our limitless promise in art, culture, research, science and technology."
Six hundred registrants and 300 million dollars estimated in pledged new investments are unmistakable signals that our investment pitch is bearing bountiful fruit.
But the vision of our Party has always stretched beyond just stony statistics to that promised land of social progress brought about by what the Father of Independence called “the mixed economy.”
"The surging economic growth, if it is to be sustained, requires more energy   clean energy."
"In pursuit of this objective, government signed a $144 million loan agreement with the Saudi Fund for Development for the construction of a 60-megawatt solar plant, an ambitious endeavor we expect will also receive support from the World Bank."
"Clean and independent energy will complement the multiple investments underway in power distribution, water and sewerage systems, and a national road network that will facilitate optimal product and service delivery and distribution, particularly for the foundational sectors of tourism and agriculture."
"Belize has been blessed with bountiful and valuable natural resources, and their ecosystem services are central to our economic sectors and development. Our natural assets are complemented by our cultural assets in developing these three important pillars in our economy and development."
"The Industrial Strategy with Blue, Green and Orange policies is a work in progress that aligns with my government’s vision, which is to develop a thriving nature-positive economy that is people-centric."
"Last year, I told you about plans to convert sargassum collected from the sea into fuel for energy. Last week, the investors and designers were here and are predicting that by this time next year, the construction of their facility will be well underway."
"Development that does not lift the people to a better quality of life lacks legitimacy. Inequitable growth cannot sustain an open society. Vitalized by this conviction, government’s investments in education, health and citizen security have reached unprecedented heights."
"$90 million has been secured, again from the Saudi Fund for Development, to construct a new tertiary-level hospital on the University of Belize’s campus here in Belmopan. This is the first new tertiary hospital to be constructed in 30 years."
"At the same time, funding has been increased for our anchor hospital facility   KHMH   as well as for regional hospitals and for clinics throughout the country. This year, the NHI was expanded to include the Orange Walk District, bringing virtually free primary healthcare access to 220,000 Belizeans."
No less than 20 cents of every recurrent dollar in this year’s national budget will go to the education system. No Belizean should be out of school because he or she cannot afford the costs of schooling.
"Quite the opposite, Belize cannot afford for even a single student to forego learning because of their economic standing. Over 20,000 students from Primary School to University have benefited from scholarships or financial assistance from the Ministry of Education at a value of close to 10 million dollars."
"Nine Schools are now a part of the Education Upliftment Project Together We Rise, which provides free tuition, uniforms, books, digital devices and healthy meals. This will expand to an additional 10 Schools in the next fiscal year."
"As with so many countries in the hemisphere, citizen security remains a foremost challenge, primarily because of the so-called curse of geography."
Drugs flow north. Guns flow south; their proceeds soil governance systems and pervert law and order.
"If multilateralism is a prerequisite to save the planet from the ravages of climate change, an equal dose of this medicine is urgently needed to suppress transnational crime."
We are more convinced than ever that the core of these multilateral cooperation programs must focus on citizen well-being and citizen opportunity rather than solely security and law enforcement.
At the root of migration is an absence of opportunity.
Heramos Beliceños
"El tema este año de nuestro aniversario de la independencia captura, con tanta claridad, este momento de la historia: nuestra visión se renueva, nuestra esperanza arde y nuestras manos se unen en una marcha imparable hacia adelante. A los cuarenta y dos años, como nación, seguimos enfrentando desafíos obvios y muy reales."
"Sin embargo, los resultados de nuestro trabajo constante desde las elecciones de noviembre 2020 muestran que #PlanBelice, nuestro Plan Nacional no solo esta funcionando, sino que funciona mucho mejor de lo que los optimistas imaginaron."
"Estoy convencido que, así como Belice superó ampliamente las proyecciones del FMI, tanto en 2021 como en 2022, confiamos en que 2023 ampliará esta tendencia de desempeño real que va a superar el desempeño previsto."
"Hoy como portadores de la antorcha de la causa perdurable, renuevo el compromiso inquebrantable de nuestro gobierno con una nación más equitativa, más prospera y más inclusiva, en paz consigo misma y con la comunidad de naciones."
"Forty-three years ago, at the brink of Independence, George Price spoke of “a peaceful constructive, progressive revolution.” It was then and it is now, a revolution against a system that was “inhumane, unjust, wrong and unjustifiable.”"
"Mr. Price called for a “wave of nationalism and national unity; an awareness of the beauty and wealth of Belize, a consciousness of the oneness of all Belizeans and an appreciation of a common heritage and common destiny for all the Belizean people.”"
"Today, as the torch bearers of that enduring cause, I renew our unshakeable commitment to a more equitable, a more prosperous and a more inclusive nation, at peace with itself and with the community of nations."
"This year’s theme captures with such clarity this moment in history: our vision is renewed, our hope burns, and our hands join in an unstoppable forward march. And with the guidance of our Creator and the support of our people, we keep ever moving forward."
"To all Belizeans at home and abroad, we proclaim:"
Long live Belize!
Que Viva Belice!
Happy Independence Day!

Thank you!


"Thank you, Mr Co-Moderator"
"Excellencies,"
"Belize is deeply troubled at the slow progress of implementation of the SDGs, a challenge mirrored at national level. While ongoing crises are deterring our efforts, systemic inadequacies at global level have long been undermining our aspirations."
"Today, I reaffirm Belize’s unwavering commitment to achieving the SDGs. These Goals remain the only ambitious, universally agreed blueprint to achieve an equitable and sustainable future for all. At home, #PlanBelize Medium Term Development strategy is guiding our actions."
"Last month, Belize convened a SDG Partnership Dialogue bringing together stakeholders to identify national commitments, guided by science, that will have a transformative impact."
"The highest priority for my government is reducing poverty. Belize commits to reducing poverty by 50% by 2030 in alignment with the fundamental principle of Leaving No One Behind. Accordingly, we will increase investments in education, and housing and child care for single mothers as well as expand health insurance."
"We are committed to redoubling our actions to build resilience and ensure that everyone wins, by:"
"* implementing the National Energy Policy, the National Land Use Policy, develop a comprehensive Industrial Strategy that integrates green and blue industrial policies, and increase investments in climate resilient infrastructure by 2026;"
"* fostering a low carbon resilient development pathway and strengthen climate change adaptation and mitigation, achieve protection of 30% of marine space by 2026, including protection of 20% of the coral reef, implement our National Blue Economy Policy, we further commit to reducing land degradation through our Land Restoration Strategy, mitigate biodiversity loss via the Revised National Biodiversity Strategy, implement Integrated Water Resource Management approaches and foster agroforestry systems;"
"* by 2024, implement a National Risk Management Plan supplemented by disaster-specific strategies for hurricanes, floods and droughts."
"* by 2025, finalize a Special Education Policy, implement Early Childhood Development Investment, expand adult remedial initiatives, skills training and upskilling;"
"* approve, by 2024, a costed Social Protection Strategy, including the Social Protection Floor and accompanying institutional mechanisms;"
"* implementing the National Agriculture and Food Policy and our Food System Pathway, including a School Feeding program;"
* implementing by 2025 our National Digital Agenda to modernize governance
* adopting a revised National Strategy for Advancing Statistical Development by 2024 to enhance evidence -based decision-making.
To accelerate achievement of all SDGs we will legally establish and resource an empowered Sustainable Development Department to coordinate the implementation of the SDGs across government.
"Regrettably, international cooperation and development finance are not at the scale required. I reiterate Belize’s urgent call for reform of the international financial architecture, the adoption of the multidimensional vulnerability index and targeted support for SIDS."
"The SDGs is a collective commitment. Taiwan and other partners are supporting our pursuit of the SDGs. Let us stand united, guided by the principles of sustainability, inclusivity, equity, and solidarity to build a sustainable future for this and future generations."
Thank you.




A People-Centric Conservation Agenda for Financing Ocean Conservation
I thank the organizers for inviting me to this this morning’s event.
It is great to be here and to feature what Belize is doing for what Time Magazine recently called “the most important place on earth”: the Oceans.
I am a citizen of beautiful Belize   a nation that depends deeply on the health of our oceans.
"Our coastal and marine environment includes a national and global treasure: the largest barrier reef in the western hemisphere and three of the four atolls in the Western Hemisphere. It supports more than 1400 species, provides food and livelihoods for almost half of our population, and generates over half a billion dollars in annual ecosystem services."
"Belizeans recognise the importance of protecting our mangrove forests that cover most of our coastlines, protecting our people and visitors while safeguarding hundreds of millions of dollars in economic infrastructure from natural disasters."
"In short, healthy oceans and coastlines are an existential condition for my people and country to flourish."
The core of our conservation commitment is to deliver outcomes that benefit the Belizean people and planet through building a nature-positive economy.
"In recent years, my government has engaged the international community to realize this vision."
"In 2021, our country finalized a Blue Bond that reduced Belize’s external debt by 12 percent, created long-term sustainable financing for marine conservation, and secured our commitment to protect 30 percent of Belize’s ocean."
"Now, our country is involved in another innovative and audacious conservation finance model called Project Finance for Permanence, or PFP for short."
"We have partnered with the World Wildlife Fund and The Nature Conservancy in this endeavor, and I am particularly thankful to Carter Roberts, WWF’s CEO, who is with us here today, for his support as we move this initiative forward."
"Belize’s PFP, which we have named Resilient Bold Belize, brings together partners from government, local communities, finance institutions, NGOs, and philanthropy to develop marine conservation outcomes that are sustainably financed for the long run."
I am proud to share our vision and ambition for this PFP and its goals which rests on three key Pilars:
"First, we will triple the full protection of our coral reef and go from 7 to 20 percent protection."
We will achieve this milestone through a scientific and stakeholder-driven process.
"Increased coral reef protection will further livelihood and food security for the Belizean people, as well as grow our blue economy."
"Second, Belize has committed to protect 30 percent of our marine environment by 2030 and we have endeavored to fast track this achievement by 2026."
"As part of the PFP, we will work with our partners and local stakeholders to designate the remaining 10 percent of our 30-by-30 commitment in areas that will support the highest biodiversity and people outcomes."
"Third, with our partners we are developing domestic and international funding mechanisms to make Belize’s diverse marine protected areas and watersheds among the best managed in the world."
To end where I began: The ocean is central to Belize’s future.
"It feeds our people, it creates jobs, it protects our infrastructure, and it brings visitors to our beautiful country."
A nature-positive economy is therefore part of our future.
"But we can’t do it alone, which is why Belize is partnering with global institutions such as WWF and The Nature Conservancy to deliver conversation that matters for people and the planet."
Thank you for your attention.
